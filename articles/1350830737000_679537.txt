Pricing details are also now available, with the Lunia 920 available for $149.99 on a new 2-year contract, and $599.99 without commitment. The 8X is $99.99 on contract, and $599.99 without, meaning those interested can get on board with Windows Phone 8 for $50 less with HTC, albeit with some trade-offs.</p>
<p>Those looking for color choice will want to opt for Nokia, however, as the HTC 8X is only available in purple through the current pre-order process, while the Nokia Lumia 920 (an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wpcentral.com/att-lumia-920-exclusive-six-months-training-videos">AT&amp;T exclusive for 6 months</a>, according to reports) comes in your choice of cyan, yellow, red, white and black. Also, the 8X has only 8GB of internal storage, while the Lumia 920 offers 32GB built-in. Both devices offer an 8 MP rear camera, but the HTC&#8217;s front facing one is 2.1 MP while the Nokia&#8217;s is 1.2.  The 8X has a 4.3-inch, 1280 x 720 display with pixel density of 342ppi, vs the Lumia 920&#8242;s 1280 x 768, 332ppi screen. Both use the same 1.5GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 processor with 1GB of internal RAM. In terms of physical dimensions, the HTC smartphone is smaller and lighter.</p>
<p>Ship date is still unknown, since all of the devices still say &#8220;Reserve today. Will ship when available&#8221; on Best Buy&#8217;s website.</p>
