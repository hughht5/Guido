He specifically mentioned the opening of a new store in Barcelona, noting that the new addition was one of Apple&#8217;s largest. And of course, &#8220;it&#8217;s absolutely gorgeous,&#8221; he said. He also gave a quick update on Apple&#8217;s Retail numbers: 380 stores in 12 countries, with 13 coming on Friday, including the first Swedish store.</p>
<p>The stores sawÂ 83 million visitors in the last quarter (April &#8211; June), Cook added.</p>
