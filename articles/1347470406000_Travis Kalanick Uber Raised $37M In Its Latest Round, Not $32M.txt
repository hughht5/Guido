Kalanick spoke about the difficulties expanding into new cities, resistance from taxi unions, regulation and the growing competition from pink-mustache-wearing competition, like Lyft.</p>
<p>Over the course of the conversation, Kalanick revealed that the company had raised $37 million in series B (its latest round), as opposed to $32 million, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/07/uber-announces-32-million-in-funding/">which was initially reported back in December</a>. The series B financing round was led by some well-known names, Shervin Pishevar&#8217;s Menlo Ventures (Shervin shaved Uber&#8217;s logo into his head at the time), with participation from Amazon&#8217;s Jeff Bezos and Goldman Sachs.</p>
