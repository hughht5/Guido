But after two years of steady increase, we&#8217;re seeing a slowdown in growth: the increase of 14% over the same period in 2011 is down from a 23% increase the year before.</p>
<p>Among the highlights in the report:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile is up 95% to $1.2 billion in half-year 2012 from $636 million the comparable period in 2011. (Compare that to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/11/solomo-update-mobile-only-social-networks-to-reach-1b-users-by-2014-800m-users-of-foursquare-other-location-services-this-year/">Gartner&#8217;s figures from earlier</a> forecasting $20.6 billion in mobile ads in 2015.</li>
<li>Digital video ads saw an increase of 18% year-over-year, bringing just over $1 billion in revenue in the first half of 2012 compared to $900 million in the first six months of 2011. (<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/09/forrester-us-online-display-ad-spend-to-hit-12-7b-in-2012-rich-media-video-leading-the-charge/">Forrester</a> the other today also singled out video and rich media as two leading components for display ads in the U.S. specifically.)</li>
<li>Search revenues are still growing but also slowing a bit. They were $8.1 billion, up 19% from nearly $6.8 billion during the same timeframe in 2011.</li>
<li>Display-ads revenues were nearly $5.6 billion, 33% of 2012 half-year revenues, up 4 percent from $5.3 billion in the first half of 2011.</li>
<li>Retail advertisers are the biggest buyer in internet ads, accounting for 20% of the total revenues at $3.4 billion. Automotive brought in $2.2 billion for first-half 2012.</li>
</ul>
<p>More to come. Refresh for updates.</p>
