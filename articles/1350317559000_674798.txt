It was first reported by <a target="_blank" href="http://9to5mac.com/2012/10/14/13-inch-macbook-pro-with-retina-display-confirmed-for-apple-event/">9to5Mac</a>, and as both 9t05Mac&#8217;s Mark Gurman and AllThingsD&#8217;s John Paczkowski have solid track records when it comes to predicting these kinds of things, this looks likely to come true.</p>
<p>The new 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro will feature the same basic body design as its larger, 15-inch cousin which Apple introduced at WWDC in June, and will have a 2560 x 1600 resolution display, according to AllThingsD&#8217;s sources. That&#8217;s a reasonable prediction, given that the current model has 2880 x 1800. Price is the big question mark, but Apple will likely bring it in under the $2199 price tag of its bigger cousin. Also, expect USB 3.0 ports in the latest Apple notebook.</p>
<p>Separately, there were also reports over the weekend that we&#8217;d see a new iMac, although that originally comes from a far less reliable source, and so far neither 9to5Mac nor AllThingsD have addressed those reports.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be sure to let you know when the official invites come through, and we&#8217;ll definitely bring you all the news from the event as it happens, when and if it happens.</p>
