The company&#8217;s advice?</p>
<p>&#8220;Moving the camera slightly to change the position at which the bright light is entering the lens, or shielding the lens with your hand, should minimize or eliminate the effect.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company has already stated that this purple flaring issue is considered <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/01/apple-support-purple-flaring-is-normal-behavior-for-iphone-5-camera/">&#8220;normal&#8221; behavior</a> for the iPhone 5, but now there&#8217;s a more thorough explanation for the issue. As some have already suspected, it has nothing to do with the iPhone&#8217;s new lens or a change in how the camera sensor handles noise &#8212; instead, light entering the camera at an angle can cause a &#8220;reflection off the surfaces inside the camera module and onto the camera sensor.&#8221;</p>
<p>That said, the quick software fix that some users were hoping for is probably out of the question for the time being. If you;ll recall, Apple has been doling out that particular morsel of advice for at least a few days now. After reaching out to the company for instance, an iPhone 5 user named Matt Van Gastel received a email response recommending that he (what else?) angle the camera away from bright light sources when snapping photos. This new response smacks a bit of Steve Jobs&#8217; recommendation to hold iPhone 4s differently in the wake of 2010&#8242;s Antennagate situation, but really &#8212; a bit of purple popping up in your photos is nothing compared to sketchy wireless connections. </p>
