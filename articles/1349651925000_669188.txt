It&#8217;s a magazine that I remember seeing on lots of shelves when I was growing up. Now Editor in Chief Liz Vaccariello tells me that the magazine has undergone a &#8220;digital transformation&#8221;, especially this year, and it&#8217;s finding a growing audience on tablets, with digital sales set to exceed newsstand copies by December.</p>
<p>As with other large, general interest publications, Reader&#8217;s Digest has had a bumpy few years. Back in 2009, it went from 12 issues a year to 10, as well as cutting the guaranteed circulation from 8 million to 5.5 million. It even <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/18/business/media/18mag.html">filed for bankruptcy</a>.</p>
<p>But the magazine is reversing that slide on at least one front — starting in January, it&#8217;s going back to a fully monthly schedule. Vaccariello says Reader&#8217;s Digest is also on-track to sell 211,000 digital issues in December, more than triple the 65,000 sold in August 2011 (though part of that growth may be due to the magazine&#8217;s traditional holiday season bump). It&#8217;s currently <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Magazines-Journals-Kindle/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=241646011">the number two magazine in the Kindle Store</a>, and according to Vaccariello, the company has been told by Apple that it&#8217;s the highest grossing app in its &#8220;competitive set.&#8221; She even brought up the magazine&#8217;s social media presence, pointing to its <a target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/ReadersDigest">1.15 million Likes on Facebook</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://klout.com/#/readersdigest">its Klout score of 88</a> (putting it behind, for example, the New Yorker&#8217;s score of 95, but hey, <a target="_blank" href="http://klout.com/#/techcrunch">one point ahead of TechCrunch</a>).</p>
<p>Since Vaccariello joined Reader&#8217;s Digest in November of last year, she says she has cut down on the organization&#8217;s &#8220;silos&#8221;, so that everyone on-staff works on both the digital and print editions. In fact, she says the digital edition has informed &#8220;the design and architecture and pace&#8221; of the print copy — for example, the buttons highlighting different sections along the side of the cover double as navigation if you&#8217;re reading on a tablet.</p>
<p>There is, of course, digital-exclusive content, including video and rich media. The magazine&#8217;s book reviews and excerpts have been surprisingly successful among tablet readers, Vaccariello adds, usually ranking among the top features in each issue (just behind the cover story and the jokes).</p>
<p>A magazine with such a broad and arguably old-school focus (the current cover: &#8220;50 secrets surgeons won&#8217;t tell you&#8221;) may seem like not seem like an obvious candidate for a digital success story, but Vaccariello says the magazine has a clear point of view — everything is written through &#8220;the lens of this belief in the power of mankind, the lens of optimism, the lens of emotion.&#8221; She adds that this isn&#8217;t meant in &#8220;a New Age-y way,&#8221; but in the sense that each issue can provide &#8220;an oasis from the snark.&#8221;</p>
<p>Plus, even if the magazine needs to win over new readers, Vacariello notes that it has enormous brand recognition.</p>
<p>&#8220;People have grown up with it,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Their grandparents read it, it was part of their homes.<br />
That serves us very well — we&#8217;re already starting on second base.&#8221;</p>
