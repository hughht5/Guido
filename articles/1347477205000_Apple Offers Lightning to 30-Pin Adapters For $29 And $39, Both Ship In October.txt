The adapter will let users charge and sync their device using existing 30-pin dock connector cables, and will also help stave off the Dockpocalypse for a while longer.</p>
<p>The Lightning to 30-pin Adapter <a target="_blank" href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/MD823/lightning-to-30-pin-adapter">retails for $29</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/MD824/lightning-to-30-pin-adapter-02-m">$39</a> if you want one with a small cable attached, and is available now on the site but doesn&#8217;t ship until October. It&#8217;s compatible with the iPhone 5, the iPod touch 5th gen, and the iPod nano 7th gen.</p>
