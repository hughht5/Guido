Chicisimo is a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/11/social-media-for-the-fashion-conscious-chicisimo-chalks-up-800k-in-angel-funding/">social media site</a> for fashionistas to post and vote on pictures of their latest looks, and then buy the look for themselves. The joint collaboration with Zappos is meant to encourage fashionistas to share pictures of their latest looks and inspire others.</p>
<p>Users can upload pictures of themselves wearing fashion items from one of 10 selected brands available on Zappos: Aldo, BCBG MAX AZRIA, Betsey Johnson, Converse, Guess, Levis, Michael Kors, Nine West, Ray-Ban or Steve Madden. Fellow users can vote for the outfits that you love or are inspired by the most and receive product recommendations f products from these brands, based on the personal style they are viewing.</p>
<p>The most inspiring looks will receive a badge, the Zappos Flower on Chicisimo; and one winner will also receive a $500 gift certificate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Zappos is excited to work with startups that develop active communities and proactively enable people to both express their individual style and have fun,” said Graham Kahr, social commerce product manager at Zappos. “Chicisimo is a shining example of the type of startup we like to work with.”</p>
<p>This a big partnership for Chicisimo. We know Zappos has been trying to think outside the box with its <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/22/zappos-labs/">Labs group</a>, which is trying to figure out the next wave of innovative ideas in commerce. With the rise in popularity of sites like Polyvore, Pinterest and others; it&#8217;s not surprising that Zappos has identified social fashion as an area worth investing in.</p>
