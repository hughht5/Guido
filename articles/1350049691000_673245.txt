Everyone? In what could be the retailer&#8217;s smartest move in years, Best Buy intends to match the prices of online retailers including Amazon this holiday season.</p>
<p>The word comes from <a target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB10000872396390444657804578050864206903402-lMyQjAxMTAyMDEwMjAxODI3Wj.html">the WSJ</a> which reports Best Buy is attempting to increase store&#8217;s close rate by preventing showrooming. The retailer states that about 40% of store visitors leave without making a purchase. No doubt a good chunk of those consumers are using Best Buy as a showroom for an Internet retailer who sells a particular item at a lower cost.</p>
<p>Details about the new price matching policy are still light. Best Buy has yet to make this plan official or release the fine print &#8212; there is no doubt plenty of exclusions. Since this report just broke, the policy is likely not yet rolled out to the stores either.</p>
