Shares (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/finance?client=ob&amp;q=NASDAQ:FB">NASDAQ:FB</a>) are currently trading 22 percent above yesterday&#8217;s price. During the earnings call, the company announced that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/23/facebook-advertising/">14 percent</a> of ad revenue are now coming from mobile ads. It is both a meaningful part of Facebook&#8217;s revenue and a shift investors were waiting for.</p>
<p>Pre-market went as high as 24.12. Yet, trading at 23.83 a share is still much below the $38 IPO level. It&#8217;s a two-month high and an optimistic indicator based on numbers â€” something that doesn&#8217;t lie. Facebook&#8217;s market capitalization gained around 10 billion dollars overnight.</p>
<p>The first quarterly earnings are very important for a public company. It all comes down to listening to investors, inspiring confidence and showing signs of growth. Facebook&#8217;s revenue is growing and following a good trend.</p>
<p>But with <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/04/facebook-tops-1-billion-monthly-users-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-shares-a-personal-note/">one billion users</a>, the ability to monetize those eyeballs is the question on everyone&#8217;s lips. In particular, the company has to transform itself to become a mobile first company. Usage numbers are soaring on mobile platforms and the company is dedicated to take advantage of that.</p>
<p>Lock-up expirations are coming up soon as well. On November 14, 777 million shares will become available for trading. It could go either way for the stock price.</p>
