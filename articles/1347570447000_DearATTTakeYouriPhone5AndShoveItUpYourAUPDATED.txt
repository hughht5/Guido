As you know, the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/hands-on-with-the-new-iphone-5/">iPhone 5</a> pre-sale begins at 12:01 Friday morning. I&#8217;m ready to pre-order like every other geek, but I can&#8217;t. Here&#8217;s the gist of it.</p>
<p>I was in Mexico last month, and before I left I added international data roaming services for two of my lines. Pretty standard for me, since I travel a lot. Those additions didn&#8217;t stick and while in Mexico, I received text messages warning me that my usage was ridonkulous and that I&#8217;d soon be poor.</p>
<p>I called AT&amp;T from my hotel room and explained the situation, and the nice gal said she&#8217;d retroactively apply, and, moving forward, make sure that those services were turned on so that I wouldn&#8217;t get charged ridiculous data roaming fees. Sweet. Go AT&amp;T.</p>
<p>So today, I log in to AT&amp;T to check my iPhone 5 eligibility and got this:</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/13/dear-att-take-your-iphone-5-and-shove-it-up-your-a/att-8/" rel="attachment wp-att-650635"></a></p>
<p>WTF???? Yep, no iPhone 5 for me unless I pay almost $2K, since the site wouldn&#8217;t even show me my eligibility. Not gonna happen. So I give AT&amp;T a ring and explain the situation to three people, including a supervisor. They&#8217;ll take the fees off, no problem&#8230;but not until the 19th.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not going to work, because I want to pre-order the iPhone 5.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing we can do, sir,&#8221; I was told by the supervisor. Well that&#8217;s horsecrap. I asked to speak to their supervisor, but was told that they were in a meeting. All of them. I asked the gent to call another call center, but he said that he couldn&#8217;t do that.</p>
<p>What can they do for me? Schedule a call for an hour from now with someone. A call, no promises.</p>
<p>Yes, I&#8217;m angry. Yes, I will move to Verizon or Sprint if that&#8217;s how I get to pre-order an iPhone 5. Does AT&amp;T care? Probably not. But here&#8217;s the thing: This is a situation that anyone could find themselves in. A situation where you are a loyal paying customer, get screwed over, and can&#8217;t even give them more money for a new phone!</p>
<p>How is that a way to do business? I have no idea. I&#8217;ll keep you updated, though. I&#8217;m getting a damn iPhone 5, and I don&#8217;t care who it&#8217;s from.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE at 3:15PM PT</strong>: Since the promised call &#8220;within one hour&#8221; didn&#8217;t happen, I had to proactively call AT&amp;T again. Not much was done though, as I&#8217;m told that &#8220;nobody here&#8221; has the power to credit my account for that large a number. Ok, not my problem, but thanks for the info. I made it clear that my intention is to pre-order an iPhone 5 through AT&amp;T, and continue being a customer. I&#8217;m not sure that anyone I&#8217;ve spoken to truly understands that part yet.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE at 3:33PM PT</strong>: I received the following text message just now:</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/13/dear-att-take-your-iphone-5-and-shove-it-up-your-a/photo-9-7/" rel="attachment wp-att-650709"></a></p>
<p>Now, I want to make sure you knew where I was coming from with this. I have heard multiple nightmarish stories about AT&amp;T and their customer service. This situation didn&#8217;t seem to be like a customer service one, as everyone was fairly nice, it was about procedure. The procedures in place at AT&amp;T do not swing towards the customer&#8217;s side in any way. I nearly had a heart attack when I saw my bill, I&#8217;m not rich. I had planned on doing my customary pre-order with AT&amp;T, and the company itself was making it impossible.</p>
<p>Will I stick with AT&amp;T for my pre-order even after this? I&#8217;m not sure. All I know is that this whole thing took too much time and caused too much frustration, and no customer, paying or not, should ever have to deal with that. AT&amp;T has enough scale to handle any situation without a hassle, but I certainly didn&#8217;t see it today. </p>
<p>FYI, I never ever brought up my post or TechCrunch while I was on the phone with AT&amp;T today, not even once. I am not a jerk, I just care deeply about customer service and experience. AT&amp;T messed up big-time, and I&#8217;m not impressed. I would still like to get that call from someone so I can offer some suggestions on how to make sure this doesn&#8217;t happen for anyone else. I had to spend way too much time and had to be way too persistent and knowledgable about how customer service elevation works.  Ugh.</p>
