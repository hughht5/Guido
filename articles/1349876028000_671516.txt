Working with 17 partners on this latest effort, the online exhibitions debuting today include stories of Apartheid, D-Day, and the Holocaust told through letters, photos, video and other documents.</p>
<p>The exhibitions are housed at the Cultural Institute&#8217;s website, which is where Google organizes and features these historical and immersive collections of manuscripts, old photographs, artifacts, and videos related to historical events. As with Google&#8217;s efforts to digitize the <a target="_blank" href="http://googleblog.blogspot.nl/2011/09/from-desert-to-web-bringing-dead-sea.html">Dead Sea Scrolls</a>, you can zoom in and out on the photos on the site as well as search across the archive for specific persons, places, events or dates.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s new additions include the following, Google <a target="_blank" href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/10/bringing-history-to-life.html">announced</a> via blog post this morning:</p>
