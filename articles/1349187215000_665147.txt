That&#8217;s stupid, right? But for folks who are walking around with little mole-shaped time bombs on their skin, understanding the difference between skin features and cancer is a pretty big deal.</p>
<p>Doctor Mole allows you to scan moles (using an AR system that&#8217;s reminiscent of Star Wars) and assess the Asymmetry, Border, Color, Diameter and Evolution (ABCDE). You can also store images of the mole over time and be reminded every few weeks to check the mole again, thereby ensuring it&#8217;s not growing or changing.</p>

The app works on iOS, Android, and Windows Phone and is secure so your pictures don&#8217;t fall into the wrong hands. It obviously doesn&#8217;t replace a doctor&#8217;s consultation but it&#8217;s still a nice way to keep abreast of the thing on your breast.<br />
