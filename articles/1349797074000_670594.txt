<p>It sounds wonky, but the strategy basically entails selling poorly performing investments at the end of the year so that they can be written off against gains in a portfolio, reducing an overall tax bill. (There&#8217;s a video that explains it below.)</p>
<p>Wealthfront says that this technique can boost after-tax returns by more than 1 percent a year. Over 20 years, that could be more than $50,000 more in returns on a $100,000 portfolio. </p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve always wanted to bring what premier endowments and wealth managers do to the masses,&#8221; said CEO Andy Rachleff, who also co-founded one of the Valley&#8217;s better-known venture firms Benchmark Capital. &#8220;Tax-loss harvesting used to be done all manually and it was only available to people with $10 to 20 million.&#8221;</p>
<p>Offering tax-loss harvesting is yet another lure for potential customers. Wealthfront, which used to be known as Kaching and was a social investment site, changed strategies over the past few years to offer low-cost, long-term investment management services. </p>
<p>Based on your age and risk tolerance, the site will recommend a certain balance between higher-risk investments like stocks and lower-risk ones like bonds. It takes a lower management fee of around 0.25 percent (instead of the 1 to 1.5% rate a mutual fund might charge.) </p>
<p>They can offer lower-management fees by automatically offering a mix of investments in exchange-traded funds (which have lower fees). Wealthfront doesn&#8217;t get any affiliate revenue for recommending certain funds over others, so Rachleff says this makes them relatively unbiased.</p>
<p>Rachleff says assets under management are growing at roughly 15 percent month over month (but he&#8217;s not disclosing the raw amount.) He says that the site&#8217;s largest accountt is $2.5 million and the smallest is $5,000. The average is around $50,000.</p>
<p>The 20-person startup is focused on growing clientele among Silicon Valley&#8217;s &#8220;working&#8221; class, like engineers and product managers that want to manage their savings or recent windfalls from acquisitions or IPOs. </p>
<p>The thinking is that these types of customers will be more comfortable having another startup manage part of their savings. That&#8217;s why Wealthfront has been doing <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.wealthfront.com/startup-employee-equity-compensation/">these savvy and very viral infographics</a> on startup compensation. </p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re fortunate enough to work for a successful company, we can manage the investment of those proceeds and do it in a really high-quality and low-cost fashion,&#8221; Rachleff said. </p>
