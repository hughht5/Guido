<p>I truly feel like co-founder Michael Dwan understands the dilemma of keeping all of your photos online and in one place, better than most companies I&#8217;ve ever discussed the subject with. It&#8217;s that, combined with a beautiful design and comprehensive, yet simple, feature set, that impresses me.</p>
<p>An obvious next step, after fully launching its pricing plan sometime soon, is a mobile app. The company is apparently starting with its eye on iOS, with later plans for Android. That seems to be a common theme, just ask Instagram.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve gotten my hot little hands on the app, and it didn&#8217;t disappoint. I&#8217;m not sure how early this build is, or when it will be submitted to Apple and then released, but I&#8217;m digging it. I hope that they don&#8217;t mind me publishing some screens, because it&#8217;s worth keeping an eye on in my opinion.</p>
<p>As you&#8217;d expect, the Snapjoy Timeline design comes over to iOS, and is a great way to go through photos you&#8217;ve taken in the past. Not just last week or last year, but like ten years ago if you have digital photos that go that far back:</p>

<p>Right now, you can import your Picasa, Flickr and Instagram photos, or upload them from your computer. I&#8217;d love to see a Facebook import super soon, though.</p>
<p>To me, this is exactly how photos should be handled in the &#8220;cloud.&#8221; While Apple has its photostream and iPhoto offerings well integrated into user&#8217;s experiences, there is definitely a spot for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.snapjoy.com">Snapjoy</a> to jump in and take over some serious marketshare. What&#8217;s next? Maybe more funding? Potentially, but the Y Combinator group has been doing just fine with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.snapjoy.com/about">its seed round</a>.</p>
