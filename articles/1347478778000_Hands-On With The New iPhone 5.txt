The new phone is just a bit longer than the current iPhone 4S and far speedier. Maps and photos flew by and the various apps popped up in a few seconds.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not as earth-shatteringly different than the iPhone 4S, to be sure. While the real benchmarks and games aren&#8217;t quite available yet, folks who haven&#8217;t used the 4S will notice a bump.</p>
<p>The screen is the real draw here and I&#8217;m really interested to see how it improves the experience in real-world conditions. Obviously you&#8217;re getting just a bit more real estate and the Lightning connector allows for far more room for battery and processor. Again, it&#8217;s far too early to tell right now, but if you&#8217;re looking for something in the sweet spot between monsters like the Galaxy S III and the arguably bordering-on-too-small (at this point) iPhone 4, this may be a good compromise.</p>
<p>Build quality is quite nice and the solid aluminum is quite unique and quite solid. Hopefully this will reduce some damage if it falls on a hard surface.</p>
<p>The iPhone 5 will be available in both black and white at the same price points as the previous generation: $199 for the 16GB model, $299 for the 32GB version and $399 for the 64GB variant.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll know far more about these phones when we get to really use them later this month but until then I can report that this is a solid and interesting improvement to a solid and interesting phone. Is it a blockbuster launch? Probably not, but it is an interstitial launch that allows Apple to update the screen size and dock connector while still hiding some tricks up its sleeve.</p>
