The app, says Google, &#8220;can help you learn about everything from local history to the latest and best places to shop, eat, and have fun.&#8221; FieldTrip is currently only available for Android (2.3+), but the developers say that an iOS version is &#8220;coming soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>The product was developed by NianticLabs, a small group inside of Google that, <a target="_blank" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/27/a-new-google-app-gives-you-local-information-before-you-ask-for-it/">according to the New York times</a>, specializes in building location-based and social mobile apps. <a target="_blank" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/27/a-new-google-app-gives-you-local-information-before-you-ask-for-it/">Talking to the New York Times</a>, NianticLabs&#8217; John Hanke said that “the idea behind the app was to build something that would help people connect with the real, physical world around them.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/27/google-launches-fieldtrip-a-location-aware-app-that-helps-you-find-cool-stuff-around-you/unnamed-2-3/" rel="attachment wp-att-661580"></a>The data is sourced from publication like Thrillist, Food Network, Eater, Cool Hunting, Arcadia and Google&#8217;s own Zagat. These, says Google, will &#8220;help you uncover hidden gems no matter where you are.&#8221; Users can choose how often they want to alerts and what topics they are interested in. Currently, the app focuses on architecture, historic places, lifestyle, food, drinks and &#8220;cool and unique&#8221; places.</p>
<p>For each one of these sections, users can choose the publications and information sources they want to include (so if you&#8217;re not a fan of Sunset Magazine, you can turn those alerts off, for example). You can also set FieldTrip up to read alerts out aloud when your phone is connected to a headset or in a car dock.</p>
<p>Interestingly, there is also an &#8220;offers and deals&#8221; section, which will show deals from <a target="_blank" href="http://offers.google.com">Google Offers</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vayable.com/">Vayable&#8217;s selection of travel experiences</a>. So far, Google hasn&#8217;t offered these kinds of ambient location-based alerts for deals in its own Offers app or through Google Now, but it&#8217;s clearly an area that could become very profitable for the company in the long run.</p>

<p>Here is a summary of the app&#8217;s highlights, according to Google:</p>
<blockquote><p>★ Discover thousands of interesting places/experiences that fall under the following categories: Architecture, Historic Places &amp; Events, Lifestyle, Offers &amp; Deals, Food Drinks &amp; Fun, Movie Locations, Outdoor Art and Obscure Places of Interest around you.</p>
<p>★ Choose from three different modes to set frequency of Field Trip notifications. See “Field Trip” worthy places around you on a map, by tapping on cards in map view to pull up enthralling points of interest around you.</p>
<p>★ Go on a Field Trip while you drive. Field Trip can detect when you’re driving and automatically “talk” about interesting places and experience around you.</p>
<p>★ Capture the memory of a special place, by sharing a wondrous discovery through email and social networks such as Google+, Twitter and Facebook.</p>
<p>★ Wondering where the gem that you recently discovered is? Find your discovered field trip cards in the “recent’ section.</p>
<p>★ Field trip learns what you love. Thumbs up or down to tune the information discovery engine.</p></blockquote>
