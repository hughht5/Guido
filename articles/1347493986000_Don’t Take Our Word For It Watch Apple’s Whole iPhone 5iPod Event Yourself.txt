<p>That said, only journalists and Apple&#8217;s own people were able to attend, but Apple has just posted <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/apple-events/september-2012/">the full video</a> of its recently wrapped event so you too can see exactly what happened on-stage.</p>
<p>I feel a warning is in order though &#8212; you should make sure to block off a solid chunk of free time first. As usual, the video can be streamed from Apple&#8217;s events page, and there doesn&#8217;t appear to be any way to actually download it just yet. No worries though, it&#8217;s only a matter of time before the entire thing winds up on YouTube, at which point you&#8217;ll be able to use your preferred tool to save the file as needed. Until then, grab some popcorn and settle in &#8212; it&#8217;s going to be a while.</p>
