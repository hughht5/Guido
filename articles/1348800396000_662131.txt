</a> Reddit user <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reddit.com/user/H3K9me2">H3K9me2</a> has discovered he has a pretty delightful power if you&#8217;re into cacophony: The ability to print remotely onto his neighbor&#8217;s printer.</p>
<p>Tapping into some strange AI zeitgeist, the post asking what exactly he should print has blown up. The thread has produced <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/10jjhj/just_discovered_i_can_print_on_one_of_my/">3875 comments</a> and hundreds of suggestions, with the overwhelming favorite being this <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_machine">&#8220;Ghost In The Machine&#8221; inspired</a> approach:</p>
<blockquote><p>Give the printer &#8216;sentience&#8217; gradually. Start off with just some errors like random alt &amp; unicode letters &amp; symbols. Slowly get on track to printing roman alphabets mixed in. Then, mix in some simple words like &#8216;hi&#8217;, &#8216;help&#8217;, &#8216;do&#8217;, etc,. Simple sentences come next. Nothing extravagant, maybe, &#8216;can you read this&#8217; &#8216;i am printer&#8217;, etc,. Move up in complexity til you reach perfect grammar and longer sentences. Talking printer.</p></blockquote>
<p>The thread goes on to provide many variations on this theme, as the concept of an anthropomorphic printer is somehow extremely resonant with the Redditors and beyond. &#8220;This is beautiful,&#8221; wrote one commenter, &#8220;When the machines finally take over I hope they remember those little acts of decency.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s great to see a technological spin on the age-old art of pranking, like streaking or prank calling, an art that threatens to be lost a world where all names and facts are Googlable. Prank printing.</p>
<p>And I hope <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reddit.com/user/H3K9me2">H3K9me2</a> actually prints all of the suggestions one by one: While the very meta &#8220;Print pictures of printers&#8221; has won my heart and &#8220;I think I&#8217;m finally getting the hang of this texting thing. -Grandma&#8221; is solid, I have to say that my favorite currently is &#8220;Blown up pic of nicholas cage (sic),&#8221; because pictures of Nicolas Cage <a target="_blank" href="http://buenastardis.tumblr.com/post/26600983066/jesus-christ-i-accidentally-sent-my-potential">are always</a> hilarious.</p>
<p>No seriously, what would you do if your printer just randomly printed out a pic of Nicolas Cage? You&#8217;d be a monster if you didn&#8217;t laugh.</p>
