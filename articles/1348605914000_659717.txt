The passport is on the counter. The Nook Simple Touch is about to hit the road. In its latest retail expansion, Barnes &amp; Noble is sending its ereader to the UK. The little ereader will be available from several large retailers starting early this October.</p>
<p>B&amp;N took to the wires today to announce three retail partnerships with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120925006694/en/Barnes-Noble-Partners-Waitrose-Offer-Award-Winning-NOOK%C2%AE">Waitrose</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120925006676/en/Barnes-Noble-Partners-Sainsbury%E2%80%99s-Offer-Award-Winning-NOOK%C2%AE">Sainsbury&#8217;s</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120925006202/en/Barnes-Noble-Continues-UK-Expansion-Partnering-Dixons">Dixons Retail</a>, which includes Currys and PC World stores. Combined, this will put the Nook Simple Touch and Nook Simple Touch with GlowLight in over 2,000 stores starting in the first part of October.</p>
<p>However, at this time, B&amp;N is only sending its ereader line to the UK. The bookseller has yet to detail the Nook Tablet&#8217;s UK retail plan &#8212; that is, if there is one.</p>
<p>B&amp;N also announced a move into video content with partnerships with HBO, Sony, Starz, Warner Bros Entertainment and Walt Disney Studios. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/25/barnes-noble-announces-nook-video-apps-launching-this-fall/">As Jordan stated this morning</a>, Nook Video might be a bit late to the game but it seems like a feature-packed service and a welcome addition to the Nook Tablet.</p>
