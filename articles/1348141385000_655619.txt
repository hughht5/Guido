<p>But this morning, as Europeans woke up to a little screen encouraging them to download the new iOS, many were not aware that their cherished Google Map would go puff into the ether and be replaced with something rather less detailed than Google&#8217;s &#8211; given Google has had <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/13/apple-maps-google-maps-ios-6-user-experience/">a seven year head start</a> on maps.</p>
<p>This morning I asked my <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/mikebutcher">40,500 Twitter followers</a>, who largely hail from Europe, what they though of the new Apple iOS map. The answer? Not much.</p>
<p>As <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/winjer">@winjer</a> pointed out, Apple renaming the English town Doncaster &#8220;Duncaster&#8221; was <a target="_blank" href="http://pic.twitter.com/pU0mfqBB">&#8220;quite special&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p>But it started to get a little more serious when one user tweeted me pointing out that Berlin had been renamed &#8220;Schoeneiche&#8221;, though they did admit that the iOS app&#8217;s positioning was &#8220;very accurate&#8221; (so, handy so long as you really do <em>know</em> you&#8217;re in Berlin),</p>
<p>In general, there will be plenty of Europeans who feel they have been &#8220;screwed on 3D&#8221; (as one person put it to me), but there may be more serious issues to content with.</p>
<p>For instance, if you&#8217;re an iPhone user in Russia &#8211; not a small market &#8211; you will now be far more inclined to use maps provided by Yandex than either Google or Apple&#8217;s. Not to mention that annoying things like Kiev <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/alex_kravets/status/248694383740874752/photo/1">being misspelled</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile over in Ireland, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thejournal.ie/iphone-maps-dublin-airport-601831-Sep2012">they appear to have sprouted a new airport</a> with Apple&#8217;s map designating &#8220;Airfield Park&#8221; in Dublin as an airport (it&#8217;s not). In Israel, &#8220;chunks of roads are missing, even from major cities&#8221; tweeted one user.</p>
<p>One <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ausbt.com.au/6-reasons-travellers-should-be-wary-of-apple-maps-in-ios-6">business traveler site</a> pointed out, searching for London can sometimes bring you to the city in Canada, and you need to type &#8220;London, UK&#8221; if you definitely want the British city.</p>
<p>The problem is that the location data the iOS app uses (from Yelp, TomTom and others) is less comprehensive than Google&#8217;s. Thus, major hotels in Tokyo are missing and the app can&#8217;t find Paddington Station in London. And that&#8217;s just a couple of examples.</p>
<p>The lack of details is also hitting user smack in the face, further a field.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in Jakarta, Indonesia, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/smagdali/status/248691257956782080/photo/1">good luck trying to find your address</a>.</p>
<p>And Shinjuku station in Tokyo <a target="_blank" href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1444486">looks totally different</a>, and lacks the complexity of Google&#8217;s map.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s to be hoped Apple takes all this feedback and starts improving its app.</p>
<p>But speaking as someone who travels a lot in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, I am tempted not to upgrade for all the reasons above. And that&#8217;s saying something from an Apple fan like myself.</p>
