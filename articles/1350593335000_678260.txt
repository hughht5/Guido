Not only did he put in a plug for Google&#8217;s new <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/18/chromebook-samsung-249/">Chromebook</a>, but also for the Nexus 7 tablet. Indeed, he told the assembled investors, press and analysts on the call that they should &#8220;all run out and buy a Nexus 7 for $199.&#8221;</p>

Page noted that Google tries to ensure that Google wants to help its users to easily transition between devices. He stressed, for example, how users can keep their searches in sync between different devices, as well as the advantages of using Chrome on Android.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most people,&#8221; Page said, &#8220;thought we were nuts&#8221; when Google launched Android, but he also stressed how mobile advertising is now a significant part of Google&#8217;s advertising revenue. Throughout the call, Google&#8217;s various executives stressed how multi-screen is now huge for video and mobile and how Google expects to improve its abilities to monetize better in this multi-screen environment.</p>
