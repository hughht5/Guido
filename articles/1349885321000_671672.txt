The exploit was discovered and successfully launched just ahead of the deadline for completion, according to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.infoworld.com/d/security/pinkie-pie-hacker-trips-chrome-hack-in-the-box-204480">early reports</a> from the event. Before awarding the cash prize, Google had to first verify and confirm the vulnerability &#8211; which it just now did, the company tells us via email. More details have also been posted to <a target="_blank" href="http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2012/10/stable-channel-update_6105.html">the Google Chrome blog</a>.</p>
<p>According to the blog post, the hack involves the following exploit:</p>
<ul>
<li>[$60,000][<a target="_blank" href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=154983">154983</a>][<a target="_blank" href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=154987">154987</a>] Critical CVE-2011-2358: SVG use-after-free and IPC arbitrary file write. Credit to Pinkie Pie.</li>
</ul>
<p>Google has set aside $2 million in prize money for hackers who find security vulnerabilities in its Chrome web browser, with $60,000 being reserved for those who find &#8220;full Chrome exploits.&#8221; $40,000 which is offered for partial exploits, and $20,000 for other bugs found in Flash, Windows, or a driver that are not necessarily specific to Chrome, but could cause issues for users. Google <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.chromium.org/2012/02/pwnium-rewards-for-exploits.html">said in February</a> that it would awards those latter prizes because it also served the company&#8217;s overall mission of &#8220;making the entire web safer.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the second time &#8220;Pinkie Pie&#8221; has earned the top prize. In March, the hacker also earned $60,000 in the first &#8220;Pwnium competition&#8221; (as the event is called) by stringing together six vulnerabilities in order to break out of Chrome&#8217;s sandbox. According to a report from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.infoworld.com/d/security/pinkie-pie-hacker-trips-chrome-hack-in-the-box-204480">Infoworld</a>, the hacker was not attending the Hack in the Box event this week, but had a colleague submit his latest entry for him.</p>
<p>Google has been offering cash rewards for those discovering security vulnerabilities and other bugs for some time. In <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/19/google-chrome-1337/">March 2010</a>, for example, the company began offering bounties for bugs found in the open-source browser Chromium (Chrome&#8217;s code base), which started at $500 and went up to $1,337 (yep, &#8220;leet&#8221; in hacker lingo).</p>
