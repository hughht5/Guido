<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/facebook-stock.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="Facebook Stock" title="Facebook Stock" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Six of Facebook&#8217;s top officers (but not Zuck) <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1214123/000120919112050635/xslF345X03/doc4.xml">filed Form 4s</a> today to notify the SEC their RSUs will vest into 45.3 million Class B shares on October 29th, but they won&#8217;t be selling any. Facebook will withhold roughly 45% of those shares and keep them from the public market in exchange for paying the tax on them so executives don&#8217;t have to pay the government up front. The tax strategy should help keep the $FB price more stable.</p>
<p>The employees filing Form 4s today are Sheryl Sandberg (COO), David Fischer (VP of ads), Mike Schroepfer aka Schrep (VP of engineering), David Ebersman (CFO) and David Spillane (Chief Accounting Officer), and Ted Ullyot (General Counsel). That&#8217;s Facebook&#8217;s entire Section 16 class of executives minus CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Zuck does not have RSUs and last month committed to not sell any shares for at least a year.</p>
<p>Facebook will withhold 21,143,119 of the Class B shares from these six employees, and in return will pay the tax on the 24,191,281 it gives them using a 50%-50% combination of cash and debt.</p>
<p>This is the same as Facebook does for all its employees. Otherwise newly vested shareholders would have to pay out of pocket for the taxes, which could be tough or encourage them to sell more of their stock right away. Facebook doesn&#8217;t want any more stock flooding the market since its share price is only $21.94, well below its IPO price. Getting that price higher over time could help it recruit and retain talent, and this tax strategy should make that easier.</p>
<p>Sandberg, Fischer, Schroepfer, Ebersman, Spillane, and Ullyot become eligible to sell their shares four days after they actually vest on October 29th. That&#8217;s the day of the next round up stock lock-up expirations.</p>
<p>Facebook will have to endure several more rounds including a huge one on November 14th where many employees will start getting their chance to sell their shares for cash on the NASDAQ. If lots of lower level employees and some notable executives sell, it could shake confidence in the company and seriously hurt the share price. Here&#8217;s the full list of lock-up expiration dates, and we&#8217;ll be watching to see if Facebook&#8217;s new revenue drivers can outweigh the shares that are sure to hit the market.</p>
