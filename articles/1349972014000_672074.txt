But another &#8220;big thing&#8221; in a decidedly smaller package is making its way to center stage as we speak.</p>
<p>Yes, you&#8217;ve <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/10/samsung-targets-europe-with-smaller-flagship-phone-galaxy-s-iii-mini-to-pack-iphone-5-sized-screen/gs3-mini-lead/">heard about it before</a>, but this time it&#8217;s official. Meet the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.samsungmobilepress.com/2012/10/11/Samsung-Introduces-GALAXY-S-III-mini,-a-compact-yet-powerful-smartphone">Galaxy S III Mini</a>.</p>
<p>We learned <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/10/samsung-targets-europe-with-smaller-flagship-phone-galaxy-s-iii-mini-to-pack-iphone-5-sized-screen/">just yesterday</a> that it would in fact be called the Galaxy S III Mini and that it came with a 4-inch display, but we knew little else. Reuters suspected it would land in Europe. Little phones are so in right now.</p>
<p>In terms of specs, we&#8217;re looking at a 4-inch Super AMOLED display with an 800&#215;480 resolution. Samsung has also opted to use a 1GHZ dual-core chip instead of that quad-core EXYNOS proc, along with throwing 1GB of RAM and an NFC chip under the hood. There&#8217;s also a 5-megapixel camera around back (capable of 720p video), and a VGA front-facing camera for video chat.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, the Galaxy S III Mini will ship with Android 4.1 Jelly Bean.</p>
<p>The little guy will come in 8GB and 16GB flavors, expandable via a microSD slot. And you&#8217;ll have a relatively standard 1,500mAh battery.</p>
<p>As you may be inferring, this is most certainly a mid-range device.</p>
<p>Samsung has diluted the Galaxy brand by throwing the word Galaxy on just about everything. But calling this phone a Galaxy S III mini is a step beyond that. The design is the same, sure, but the design is hardly what makes the Galaxy S III great. In fact, it&#8217;s one of the flagship&#8217;s few shortcomings.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say it&#8217;s an awful phone. But the screen resolution, in particular, and the lack of LTE connectivity definitely puts a damper on things.</p>
