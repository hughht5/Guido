<p>In a <a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/106717946845088683921/posts/A1PMNKchcxQ">post on Google+</a>, Chee Chew of Google discussed these improvements, which include the ability to block people, set a Hangout to 18+, and change a Hangout to public while it&#8217;s in progress.  All of these features give you more awareness of your surroundings during any given chat on the platform.</p>
<p>This is about safety, Chew explains.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a bit of a breakdown of these features, some of which have already been rolled out:</p>
<p>Google+ Hangouts now inform you when extended circles have been invited to a Hangout or when the Hangout has been switched to public:</p>

<p>Also, you now will know when someone in your Hangout has blocked someone for being annoying, and you can then do the same if you wish:</p>

<p>Finally, if you want to hang out with just adults, not necessarily doing &#8220;adult things&#8221; that are against Google TOS, you can now set a Hangout to 18+ mode:</p>

<p>These are nice additions to a platform that many are using for business and personal purposes. Of course, Google has signed a deal with the NFL, and <a target="_blank" href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2012/08/01/hangouts-breaks-out-of-google-will-power-nfl-com-fantasy-football-experience/">Hangouts are being used for fantasy football junkies everywhere</a>.</p>
<p>Bonus points &#8212; Chew ended his post with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>ps.  a math joke for you:<br />
q: why did the chicken cross the road?<br />
a: to find a vector orthogonal to itself and the road.</p></blockquote>
<p>Okily doke, then.</p>
