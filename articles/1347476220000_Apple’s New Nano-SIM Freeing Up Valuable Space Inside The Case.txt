The new nano-SIM is 44 percent smaller than existing micro-SIM designs, which may not seem significant in something already so small, but which could ultimately give Apple a lot more to work with.</p>
<p>When it comes to adding more battery or new radios to the iPhone, the key to getting it done is freeing up space taken up by other elements. The nano-SIM does just that, minimizing the key component&#8217;s internal footprint, which may help account for why the new iPhone manages to get battery life on par with its predecessor despite a larger screen and LTE built-in.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was talk of Apple replacing SIM cards altogether with a built-in solution integrated inextricably into the phone itself. That proposed change met with the ire of carriers according to <a target="_blank" href="http://gigaom.com/apple/france-telecom-ceo-carriers-oppose-apples-integrated-sim/">France Telecom CEO Stéphane Richard</a>, and so Apple went the route of the nano-SIM instead. Eventually, I&#8217;d bet Apple will still push for an integrated SIM, since in-case real estate will only become more valuable, not less.</p>
