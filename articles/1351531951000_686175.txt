Microsoft argues quality over quantity, which is better for developers and consumers alike in terms of discoverability. But that&#8217;s only if you can migrate from one platform to another without feeling like you&#8217;re losing things.</p>
<p>But with the newly announced apps on Windows Phone 8, new users should see all the same apps they&#8217;ve grown to know and love.</p>
<p>According to today&#8217;s Windows Phone 8 announcement, 46 of the top 50 mobile apps are now migrating over to the platform. This includes Temple Run, Cut The Rope, LivingSocial, Urban Spoon, Angry Birds Star Wars and plenty more.</p>
<p>In fact, Pandora will be available in 2013 with one year ad-free.</p>
<p>Perhaps that will make a difference as Microsoft partners with HTC, Nokia and others to elbow its way into the mobile arena with the likes of Google and Apple.</p>
