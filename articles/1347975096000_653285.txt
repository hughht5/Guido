The debut, strategically planned in London, raises questions of whether Motorola can claw back market share in Europe &#8212; where it&#8217;s been hammered as Android buyers opt for Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy range of devices (before Sammy, it was HTC making all the running).</p>
<p>The Razr i is also interesting because it&#8217;s Intel&#8217;s first smartphone from a very recognisable mobile maker. Earlier this year the Intel-powered Orange San Diego launched in partnership with UK mobile network Orange. A third Intel-powered phone, the ZTE Grand X IN, is due to arrive this month.</p>
<p>But neither Orange nor ZTE have the brand stature of Motorola &#8212; which is now <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/15/breaking-google-buys-motorola-for-12-5-billion/">owned by Google</a> and still commands a sizeable chunk of the US market. ComScore pegged Motorola&#8217;s share at <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/13/goodbye-moto-google-will-send-out-4000-motorola-pink-slips-starting-today-cuts-will-be-across-the-board/">11.7 per cent</a>, last month, behind Samsung, LG and Apple. Not &#8216;knock it out the park&#8217; performance, by any means, but considerably better than it&#8217;s doing in Europe.  In the three months ending July 2011, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2011/9/Android_Captures_number_2_Ranking_Among_Smartphone_Platforms_in_EU5">ComScore calculated Motorola&#8217;s share</a> of the smartphone market in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK at just 3.6 per cent &#8212; versus 31.7 per cent for Samsung and 34.6 per cent for HTC.</p>
<p>Playing tech specs top trumps is one way for Motorola to try and claw back market share in Europe &#8212; price could be another. Moto says the Intel chip inside the Razr i can achieve speeds of 2GHz &#8212; making it faster on paper than high end rival devices such as the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy S3, although, being single-core, it&#8217;s arguably less suited to certain tasks like multitasking.</p>
<p>As an Android OEM Moto also has to worry about standing out from the &#8216;droid-packing crowd &#8212; and adding Intel chips is certainly one way for it to differentiate from Samsung and HTC. But, as Gartner analyst Roberta Cozza notes: &#8220;Power and performance is just one part of the smartphone market &#8212; it&#8217;s also about apps and ecosystems.&#8221;</p>
<p>Add in a question-mark over whether the Intel brand cachet can translate from PCs to the smartphone space &#8212; tiny blue creatures jumping around on a phone might be more likely to conjure thoughts of bacteria than &#8216;OMG I must buy this phone&#8217; &#8212; and leaning on Intel for a comeback remains a gamble for Motorola.</p>
<p>&#8220;Power and performance need to be translated into benefits the consumer can understand &#8212; such as responsiveness,&#8221; says Cozza. &#8220;The Intel logo &#8212; to the average consumer &#8212; is not going to say very much.&#8221;</p>
<p>Partnering with Intel may have one big bonus for Moto though: marketing support. And with Android behemoths like Samsung so dominant in Europe Moto needs all the marketing help it can get here.</p>
<p>From a technology point of view, Intel&#8217;s chips themselves have yet to conclusively prove themselves as offering something worth sitting up and taking special notice of in the ARM dominated smartphone arena.</p>
<p>Like the San Diego the Razr i includes a photo burst model that allows a continuous sequence of photos to be snapped &#8212; 10 in less than a second. But photo burst modes are not unique to Intel powered phones &#8212; both HTC and Samsung have added similar continuous shooting features to their phones this year.</p>
<p>Intel also makes claims of improved stability for its chips running Android &#8212; but it has had to concede that not all Android apps are compatible with its chips (some five per cent aren&#8217;t, at the last count) so it&#8217;s been a case of swings and roundabouts thus far.</p>
<p>Setting aside the specs and technical capabilities of the Razr i, the biggest differentiator may well be price.  No official price has been announced yet but judging by the Razr M&#8217;s tiny $99 toll and the mid range pricing of the Orange San Diego the Razr i might come packing its own competition-undercutting price-tag.</p>
<p>On the question of why Intel has chosen Europe as its smartphone testing ground, Cozza reckons it&#8217;s possible the carrier landscape has given it more of an &#8216;in&#8217; here. In addition to the Orange San Diego, Intel chips have also found their way into a Russian carrier-branded smartphone &#8212; Megafon&#8217;s Mint device. It would seem that even a company as huge as Intel can benefit from a little helping hand when it&#8217;s trying to break new ground.</p>
<p>IHS Screen Digest analyst, Ian Fogg, also makes the point that Intel&#8217;s chips don&#8217;t currently support LTE &#8212; which precludes them from being launched in the US, and makes Europe, where 3G still dominates, a more obvious choice, despite Moto&#8217;s relative weakness here.</p>
<p>The Razr i launch is also &#8220;a big vote of confidence by Google in Intel&#8217;s technology&#8221;, Fogg adds.</p>
