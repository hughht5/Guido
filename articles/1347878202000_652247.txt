The One won&#8217;t be available until October but I carried Zip around for a week or so already and found it to be quite fun and capable.</p>
<p>The Zip is a departure from the original &#8220;clothespin&#8221; style Ultra in that it can be removed from its case to create a sort of pedometer lozenge. It also runs on a single watch battery that lasts for six months, making it far more interesting to folks who don&#8217;t want to lug their charger with them.</p>
<p>The Zip is similar to the first Fitbit in that it measures steps taken, calories, and distance. It does not support stairs taken, which could be a dealbreaker for fans of the current model. Most important, it does away with Fitbit&#8217;s pretty growing flower iconography &#8211; a flower grew when you exercised more &#8211; and instead replaces it with a smiling face that beams at you when you&#8217;ve gotten off your couch.</p>
<p>Instead of a cradle, Fitbit includes a small dongle for USB devices as well as low power Bluetooth support for syncing with mobile devices.</p>
<p>The other new Fitbit, the One, features everything the Ultra had, including the stair meter, as well as Bluetooth 4.0 support. The One also has a gradual alarm for waking yourself from sleep, something that was missing in the original models.<br />

<p>Why a Fitbit? I&#8217;ve found that the Fitbit really helps you understand your activity levels. While it&#8217;s not a complete indicator of fitness, it&#8217;s nice to know I&#8217;ve been sitting down all day long and could probably use a walk. While I wouldn&#8217;t say it&#8217;s a great weight loss tool, it&#8217;s definitely an excellent reminder and prod for adding a bit more physical activity to your day. I&#8217;m definitely more interested in the One, shown below, when it becomes available because of the gradual alarm and stair feature. </p>
