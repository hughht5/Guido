<p>At the time that <a target="_blank" href="https://path.com/">Path</a> was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/14/path-photo-sharing/">first introduced</a> as a new social network for mobile devices, there were already many options for connecting with friends, family, and coworkers. So why build another? Path CEO and co-founder <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/dave-morin">Dave Morin</a> told me in an interview backstage at TechCrunch Disrupt that he and his cofounders were looking for ways to connect users closest to one another &#8212; and building for mobile was the best way to do that.  </p>
<p>&#8220;If you look at how people use mobile phones&#8230; You really don&#8217;t have that many people on your favorites list,&#8221; Morin said. &#8220;We looked at mobile as this medium which people use to communicate and manage and maintain the relationships of the people that are closest to them.&#8221; As a result, one of the reasons Path took the strategy it did was to focus on the people who are family or very close.</p>
<p>With that close-knit community focus, Path tries to solve a different problem than other social networks. Morin said that previously, there was no good way to share thoughts or photos with those closest to you, except through SMS and email. &#8220;Our competition isn&#8217;t what anyone else is doing in the social networking world, it&#8217;s actually SMS and email,&#8221; Morin told me. &#8220;We&#8217;re going and creating a better experience for sharing these important moments of your life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We like to call Path a personal network,&#8221; Morin said. &#8220;What would you expect in your home? What would you expect in your personal life? A lot of the types of content we allow people to share has direct impact on people&#8217;s personal lives.&#8221; Morin noted that when people go to sleep or wake up is something that their significant others would know about. And if you go to a lot of movies or restaurants, that&#8217;s the type of information you would share with your closest friends. </p>
