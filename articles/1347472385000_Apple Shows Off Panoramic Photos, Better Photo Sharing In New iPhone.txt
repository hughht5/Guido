The camera offers an 8-megapixel sensor, a 5-element lens and f/2.4 aperture, and it includes a dynamic low light mode and 40% faster image capture. But the more intriguing thing about the camera and the accompanying photo album features, is that Apple is again encroaching on app developers&#8217; territory with the addition of things like support for panoramic photos and shared photo streams.</p>
<p>We heard about these features previously, but now they&#8217;re official. The Shared Photo Streams feature is arguably the most practical addition, since previously sharing photos by email limited users to sending 5 photos at a time. MMS&#8217;ing photos is also not ideal. Photo Streams allow users to share a set of photos &#8211; something which a number of iOS apps allow for today. For some apps, sharing photos is all they do. Apple&#8217;s message to developers: if the only thing your app does is make it easier for iOS users to share photos, it&#8217;s time to retool and rethink.</p>
<p>The Panoramic photos feature can now product a 28-megapixel image, which is also impressive. And yep, apps like 360 Panorama will now have to convince their user base that they&#8217;re offering a better alternative to Apple&#8217;s default here. </p>
