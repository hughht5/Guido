There will be incredible speakers going, some of which include: Box CEO Aaron Levie, Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s own Marc Andreessen, eBay CEO John Donahoe, Mozilla&#8217;s Brendan Eich, Nest Labs&#8217; Tony Fadell, and many more. You can view the whole list of speakers and the event agenda <a target="_blank" href="https://www.box.com/boxworks/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Not only will there be amazing speakers and discussions, with any event, of course there will be after parties. So, the special winner of this giveaway is going to win a free ticket to the event, plus a VIP ticket to the after parties. A fun fact about this VIP ticket means &#8212; Weezer will be at a party. The winner will get to party, meet, and hang out with them.</p>
