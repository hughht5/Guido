<p>Here&#8217;s an investment out of left field, but not really. Andreesen Horowitz is dropping $15M into startup Rap Genius.  </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://rapgenius.com/Marc-andreessen-why-andreessen-horowitz-is-investing-in-rap-genius-lyrics">what the firm had to say by way of Rap Genius&#8217; blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m delighted to announce that Andreessen Horowitz is investing $15 million in Rap Genius.</p>
<p>Given that Rap Genius is a web site where people explain rap lyrics, and given that my partner Ben is a noted rap fanatic, your first reaction might be, &#8220;That Horowitz guy has completely lost his mind.&#8221; I, on the other hand, find rap every bit as comprehensible as ancient Mesopotamian. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m writing this blog post – not him. Let me explain why we&#8217;ve invested in Rap Genius&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>We knew that Ben Horowitz was a rap fan, but to the tune of $15M? We had no idea. Rap Genius is a community of people super into the musical genre, and says it is one of the &#8220;fastest growing web sites in Y Combinator&#8217;s history.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is developing.</p>
