Andreesen Horowitz is dropping $15M into startup Rap Genius.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://rapgenius.com/Marc-andreessen-why-andreessen-horowitz-is-investing-in-rap-genius-lyrics">what the firm had to say by way of Rap Genius&#8217; blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m delighted to announce that Andreessen Horowitz is investing $15 million in Rap Genius.</p>
<p>Given that Rap Genius is a web site where people explain rap lyrics, and given that my partner Ben is a noted rap fanatic, your first reaction might be, &#8220;That Horowitz guy has completely lost his mind.&#8221; I, on the other hand, find rap every bit as comprehensible as ancient Mesopotamian. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m writing this blog post â€“ not him. Let me explain why we&#8217;ve invested in Rap Genius&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>We knew that Ben Horowitz was a rap fan, but to the tune of $15M? We had no idea. Rap Genius is a community of people super into the musical genre, and says it is one of the &#8220;fastest growing web sites in Y Combinator&#8217;s history.&#8221;</p>
<p>After making a few quips about Ben Horowitz&#8217; rap fascination, Andreessen reveals that the real reason the top VC is investing in Rap Genius is that the founder&#8217;s grand vision goes beyond rap music to all text annotation.</p>
<p>Rap Genius want to &#8220;annotate the world&#8230; be the knowledge about the knowledge&#8230; create the Internet Talmud,&#8221; Andreessen writes, explaining that the service, which allows people to provide context around text, can be used to annotate literature, poetry, the Bible, political speeches, legal text, academic papers and &#8220;all culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The potential of this company is large,&#8221; Andreessen writes.</p>
<p><em>This is developing.</em></p>
