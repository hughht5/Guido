The Mint cleaner will join iRobot&#8217;s Roomba line.</p>
<p>In a press release that touts the move as an expansion of iRobot&#8217;s &#8220;position as global robotic floor care market-leader,&#8221; the company announced that it paid cash for Evolution out of its own reserves.</p>
<p>ER was founded in 2001 and launched the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/25/review-mint-floor-cleaning-robot/">Mint floor cleaner</a> in 2010. Because Mint is designed for hardwood floors, the essentially non-competing products will target different markets. The Roombas, in other words, will take the rugs while the Mints will take the parquet.</p>
<p>Evolution also offers the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.evolution.com/products/northstar/">Northstar navigation platform</a> that helps Mint return to its base station as well as the delightfully named <a target="_blank" href="http://www.evolution.com/core/navigation/vslam.masn">vSLAM mapping system</a>, whichÂ uses a small camera and dead reckoning to asses a robot&#8217;s position in space.</p>
<p>The CEO of Evolution Robotics, Paolo Pirjanian, will become iRobot CTO. The acquisition will close in Q4 2012.</p>
