Net sales grew to $13.81 billion, up 27 percent from the same period last year. The company saw a net loss $274 million, or 60 cents per diluted share, compared to operating income of $63 million last year.</p>
<p>Analysts had predicted sales of $13.60 billion and a loss of 8 cents per share.</p>
<p>Breaking sales down geographically, Amazon says North American sales were $7.88 billion, up 33 percent year-over-year, and international sales were $5.92 billion, up 20 percent. Media sales grew 11 percent to $4.6 billion, while sales of electronics and other general merchandise grew 36 percent, to $8.56 billion.</p>
<p>The earnings report includes this statement from CEO Jeff Bezos:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our approach is to work hard to charge less. Sell devices near breakeven and you can pack a lot of sophisticated hardware into a very low price point. And our approach is working – the $199 Kindle Fire HD is the #1 bestselling product across Amazon worldwide. Incredibly, this is true even as measured by unit sales. The next two bestselling products worldwide are our Kindle Paperwhite and our $69 Kindle. We’re selling more of each of these devices than the #4 bestselling product, book three of the Fifty Shades of Grey series. And we haven’t even started shipping our best tablet – the $299 Kindle Fire HD 8.9” ships November 20.</p></blockquote>
