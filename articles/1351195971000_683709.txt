Analysts had been predicted growth in sales along with a net loss, and that&#8217;s what happened — but the numbers still fell a bit short. Net sales grew to $13.81 billion, up 27 percent from the same period last year. The company saw a net loss $274 million, or 60 cents per diluted share, compared to operating income of $63 million last year.</p>
<p>Analysts had <a target="_blank" href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/stocks/amazon-com-third-quarter-earnings-sneak-peek.html/">predicted</a> revenue of $13.9 billion and a loss of 8 cents per share. Amazon&#8217;s net income has been <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/26/amazon-q2-2012/">falling for the past couple of quarters</a>, as you can see in the chart below.</p>
<p>Breaking sales down geographically, Amazon says North American sales were $7.88 billion, up 33 percent year-over-year, and international sales were $5.92 billion, up 20 percent. Media sales grew 11 percent to $4.6 billion, while sales of electronics and other general merchandise grew 36 percent, to $8.56 billion.</p>
<p>As usual, Amazon isn&#8217;t including sales numbers for specific devices. Instead, there&#8217;s lots of crowing about the specs of the various new Kindle devices, and this statement from CEO Jeff Bezos does reveal how the products stack up against each other:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our approach is to work hard to charge less. Sell devices near breakeven and you can pack a lot of sophisticated hardware into a very low price point. And our approach is working – the $199 Kindle Fire HD is the #1 bestselling product across Amazon worldwide. Incredibly, this is true even as measured by unit sales. The next two bestselling products worldwide are our Kindle Paperwhite and our $69 Kindle. We’re selling more of each of these devices than the #4 bestselling product, book three of the Fifty Shades of Grey series. And we haven’t even started shipping our best tablet – the $299 Kindle Fire HD 8.9” ships November 20.</p></blockquote>
<p>The company is providing fourth-quarter guidance that sales will grow between 16 percent and 31 percent, to somewhere between $20.25 billion and $22.75 billion, with operating income/loss anywhere between a $490 million loss and $310 million income.</p>
<p>As of 4:38pm Eastern, Amazon shares are down 0.43 percent, to $221.97, in after-hours trading.</p>
