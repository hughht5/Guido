A new startup called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.clarity.fm">Clarity</a> launched <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/03/clarity-mobile-mentorship-app/">five months ago</a> with a straightforward but lofty goal: It wanted to give people all over the world access to the kind of expert advice that could help them attain success in their careers and running their own businesses.</p>
<p>To do this, Clarity built a platform to arrange one-on-one phone calls between budding entrepreneurs and mentors such as successful businesspeople and venture capitalists. The people who are giving advice, which include billionaire businessman <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/mark-cuban">Mark Cuban</a>, 500 Startups venture capitalist <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/dave-mcclure">Dave McClure</a>, and &#8220;lean startup&#8221; guru <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/eric-ries">Eric Ries</a>, can either talk for free or set a price for their time &#8212; those fees can be either kept or donated to a charity. Clarity makes money by taking a 15 percent commission on non-charity fees.<a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/logo-whiteonblue.jpg" rel="lightbox[677194]"></a></p>
<p>It is a really fascinating and positive concept, but you have to wonder &#8212; have people really used it? More and more people say they don&#8217;t conduct their communications over the phone, and there is the potential for the mentors to lose interest in giving advice. </p>
<p>So it was great to have Clarity&#8217;s founder and CEO <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/dan-martell">Dan Martell</a> swing by TechCrunch TV this week to give an update on how the service has been going since launch and share some stats. According to him, the company&#8217;s traction has indeed been strong: More than 12,000 calls have been processed through the service, with entrepreneurs from nearly 50 countries around the world. Its mentor list is at 6,000 and counting, he says.</p>
<p>Watch the video above to hear Martell talk about the company&#8217;s growth thus far, why he started Clarity, its latest feature updates, what the most common piece of advice he personally hands out on the platform is, and much more.</p>
