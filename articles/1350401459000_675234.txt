<em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.beatsbydre.com">Beats By Dre</a></em> is best known for its flagship line of headphones, which can be spotted on hip teenagers, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/branding/how-beats-by-dre-got-their-headphones-on-1007711552.story">Olympic athletes</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pJOZmSYiH4c/TuFaut2HiiI/AAAAAAAAAHY/JubJt5H8brE/s1600/gwen+stefani.jpg">high-end celebrities</a> alike &#8212; perhaps partly because of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/17/200-headphone-review-battle-bowers-wilkins-p3-vs-beats-by-dr-dre-solo/">the $200-some price tag</a>, they&#8217;re a bit of a fashion statement among some people, so they are almost just as often being used as decoration around the neck as they are for listening to music. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just visual anecdotes that signal how strong the company&#8217;s reach is: According to data out of NPD, Beats owns more than 56 percent of the premium $100+ headphone market in North America, and 29 percent of the North American headphone market overall. </p>
<p>But over the years, the company, which was founded in 2008 by rapper and producer <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Dre">Dr. Dre</a> and music executive <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Iovine">Jimmy Iovine</a>, has worked to build up its stable of products beyond those ubiquitous headphones. Several years ago Beats By Dre launched the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.beatsbydre.com/speakers/beatbox/beatbox,default,pd.html">Beatbox</a>, a line of speakers, which started as a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.beatsbydre.com/speakers/beats-pill/beats-pill,default,pd.html">furniture-sized item</a> and eventually came out with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.beatsbydre.com/speakers/beatbox-portable/beatbox-portable,default,pd.html">smaller and more portable wireless versions</a>. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/beatspill.jpg" rel="lightbox[675234]"></a>And today, Beats By Dre is going even farther into the &#8220;ultra-portable&#8221; space that rests right between headphones and larger speakers with the launch of The Pill wireless speaker. The Pill is going right up against the <a target="_blank" href="https://jawbone.com/speakers/jambox/overview">Jambox</a>, the super popular ultra-portable speaker <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/04/jawbone-jambox-review-unboxing/">offering from Jawbone</a>. At $199, the Pill is <a target="_blank" href="https://jawbone.com/speakers/jambox/overview">exactly the same price</a> as the Jawbone Jambox, and Beats is making no bones about the fact that this product is made to be a head-on competitor.</p>
<p>This launch is also a big deal for <em>Beats By Dre</em> since it marks its first product that has been developed outside of a partnership with Monster Cable, the electronics company it had worked with since 2008. Beats&#8217; SVP of Marketing <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/omarjohnson">Omar Johnson</a> tells me that over the past year, Beats has grown from its full-time staff count from 20 to 150, and is now focused on doing things like R&amp;D and contracting the manufacturing in-house &#8212; becoming much more vertically integrated. The Pill is the first product to hit the market that has been built so completely by the Beats team alone. </p>
<p>Johnson was in San Francisco last week and swung by TechCrunch to give us a hands-on look at the Pill and talk about the company&#8217;s strategy overall. Watch the video embedded above to hear more about the road to this product, how Beats as a company has evolved, and what other new gadgets are on the roadmap ahead (hint: Bose, watch your back.)</p>
