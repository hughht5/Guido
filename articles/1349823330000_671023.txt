<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/publicstuff.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="publicstuff" title="publicstuff" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.publicstuff.com">PublicStuff</a>, the New York City based startup that makes a system to let citizens make real-time requests to their local governments for public services, has raised $5 million in new funding. The financing was disclosed today in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1534811/000153481112000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">a filing</a> to the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to PublicStuff for details on who the latest investors are and how the new funding will be deployed, but a representative for the company declined to comment. We will be sure to issue updates with any more information we receive.</p>
<p>PublicStuff&#8217;s last funding round was in November 2011, when the company <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1534811/000153481111000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">brought $1.5 million</a> which was <a target="_blank" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/publicstuff-2011-11">reportedly from</a> Lerer Ventures, First Round Capital and High Peaks Venture Partners. PublicStuff was co-founded in 2009 by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.publicstuff.com/about">CEO Lily Liu and CTO Vincent Polidoro</a> and first launched at the <a target="_blank" href="http://venturebeat.com/2010/09/14/demo-publicstuff/">Fall 2010 DEMO conference</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s PublicStuff&#8217;s value proposition: Say you notice a pothole in the street or lingering trash on a curb, and you want to report it to the authorities. The way that most cities typically manage the reporting and handling of such issues is through a telephone line or a basic email inbox, which means that the reception and handling of public requests can be slow and spotty. PublicStuff has made a web-based system aimed at providing a faster and more efficient way for such requests to be submitted, received, and closed out. </p>
<p>On the public-facing side, PublicStuff&#8217;s system lets people report outstanding issues to the relevant local authorities via the web or its apps for <a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/publicstuff/id359891920?mt=8">iOS</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wassabi.psmobile&amp;hl=en">Android</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/44415/?lang=en">Blackberry</a>. On the government&#8217;s side, PublicStuff provides a web program for city staff members to monitor the inbound service requests and manage the assignments. People who make requests can check back in on the progress of the fix. </p>
<p>In addition to local governments, PublicStuff&#8217;s offering is also available to the likes of landlords and educational institution &#8212; basically, it&#8217;s open to be used by any entity who handles a number of consistent inbound service requests.</p>
<p>With people flocking to cities more and more, and the demand for more tech-savvy government growing consistently, it seems that PublicStuff&#8217;s offering could be well-positioned for even more traction going forward. According to a recent <a target="_blank" href="https://publicstuffmediaroom.wordpress.com/">press release</a> from the company, PublicStuff is already in use in over 200 cities nationwide. It&#8217;ll be interesting to see what the company does now that it has some more funding in its coffers. </p>
