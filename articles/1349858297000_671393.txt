Terms of the deal remain undisclosed.</p>
<p>The acquisition gives Kobo access to the Aquafadas Digital Publishing System, which the company says will enable it to bring a selection of rich media â€“- magazines, academic journals, comics, kid&#8217;s books and more &#8212; to its customers, by providing better content creation tools for publishers.</p>
<p>Aquafadas&#8217;s Digital Publishing System offers a complete digital publishing suite &#8212; from content design to cross-platform distribution and analytics, and combines content design tools with a &#8220;versatile library of ready-to-use apps&#8221;, ePub3 export, and a Web reader. Thus enabling publishers to create richly designed without the need for any coding chops. The Kobo hook up is about bringing distribution directly to that publishing platform.</p>
<p>In related news, Kobo&#8217;s self-publishing platform, Kobo Writing Life, is now available in German, French, Italian, Portuguese and Dutch, in addition to English &#8211; with several new languages planned &#8220;over the coming months&#8221;. Since its launch in July, the company says that Kobo Writing Life has doubled month over month, with authors spanning 82 countries, publishing in 17 languages. Its Writing Life self-publishing feature should also benefit from today&#8217;s acquisition with better tools.</p>
