<p>McNealy covers a lot of topics. He discusses his new startup <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wayin.com/">WayIn</a> that provides a corporate social media experience. He jokingly says Larry (Ellison) never calls, referring to Oracle, which acquired Sun Microsystems, the company he co-founded.</p>
<p>Later in the interview we got into the topic of open source. That&#8217;s where it gets interesting. He says the tech world no longer has a major corporate supporter for open source. Further, purchasing agents and IT managers are not quantifying the &#8220;barrier to exit.&#8221; He means that IT is not taking into account what the true cost of total ownership is when they buy from a product company that sells proprietary technology.</p>
<blockquote><p>I think people need to think about the lifecycle of technology products.</p></blockquote>
<p>McNealy is so right on. His remarks should give pause to anyone considering buying a closed technology product especially in this time when the vendor marketing band is pushing customers to invest in entirely new infrastructures and a host of products and services with such long-term implications.</p>
