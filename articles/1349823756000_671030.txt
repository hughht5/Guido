While LG&#8217;s Optimus G may garner all the love, the newly-revealed LG Mach deserves its share of attention, and I got a bit of hands-on time to do just that.</p>
<p>First off, let&#8217;s talk looks. The Mach&#8217;s industrial design won&#8217;t bring home many rewards, but it&#8217;s nice, well proportioned (at 12.2mm, it&#8217;s pretty slim for a slider), and largely lacking of frills. Don&#8217;t take that as a negative though &#8212; some of Sprint&#8217;s other QWERTY sliders seem clunky and overly-designed in comparison (I&#8217;m looking at you, Photon Q). That said, the Mach&#8217;s rear end is strangely nondescript silver, with a strip of lighter plastic surrounding the 5-megapixel camera, and a chrome-esque finish running around the edges.</p>
<p>Perhaps naturally for a mid-range device, LG opted to use a string of three capacitive navigation keys along the bottom of the 4-inch WVGA display rather than on-screen buttons, but the most annoying bit? The sleep/wake button is stuck on the top left corner of the device, a choice that flies in the face of my muscle memory.</p>
<p>For all that a device like this brings to the table, it&#8217;s probably going to live or die based on one thing: the keyboard. LG ran with a nicely-spaced, five row affair here, and I didn&#8217;t find much to complain about during by brief time playing with it. The keys themselves have a respectable amount of travel and yield up a satisfying click when depressed. I&#8217;ve never been sold on the need for up, down, left, and right keys on a keyboard, but hey &#8212; someone must like them.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s always a little tough to talk performance after such a brief spell of testing, but for what it&#8217;s worth the Mach was remained pretty darned snappy as I scrolled through app lists, settings, and menus. That&#8217;s all thanks to the dual-core Qualcomm MSM8960 (the same as the one in devices like AT&amp;T&#8217;s HTC One X and the Droid Incredible 4G LTE) and the 1GB of RAM &#8212; nothing earthshaking, but still a clearly potent combination.</p>
<p>The Mach runs Android 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich, but all the most hardcore users will spend most of their time interacting with LG&#8217;s custom UI. I used to be very militant about these sorts of things and railed for stock Android builds for all devices, but LG&#8217;s particular take on Ice Cream Sandwich doesn&#8217;t seem too offensive&#8230; though I still prefer the cold digitalism of untouched Ice Cream Sandwich.</p>
<p>There isn&#8217;t a ton of bloatware to be found either; there were only two Sprint-branded apps here and LG&#8217;s own applications (think SmartShare media streaming, a more robust video editor, etc.) are neat, if possibly unnecessary additions. The software keyboard leaves a bit to be desired, but really &#8212; chances are if you spend money on a device like this, you probably won&#8217;t be typing on-screen too much.</p>
<p>All things considered, there&#8217;s a lot to like about the LG&#8217;s mid-range Mach. The keyboard itself will draw its share of fans, and the rest of the spec sheet adds up to a device that&#8217;s perfectly adequate. Of course, exactly how good a buy it&#8217;ll be remains unclear &#8212; neither Sprint nor LG were willing to talk about pricing (or availability) just yet. </p>
