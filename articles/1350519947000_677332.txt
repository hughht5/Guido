The festivities start at 10:00 and the event will also be live streamed on YouTube, seemingly indicating this is a big announcement. The invite sheds little light on the subject matter, but that&#8217;s the date <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/05/google-lg-nexus-october-report/">long-rumored</a> for the launch of LG Nexus smartphone. </p>
<p>There have been rumblings for several weeks now concerning the next Nexus smartphone. It&#8217;s reported to be an LG handset and several product shots have leaked out. Very little is known about the hardware, though, besides that it has a backside <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/09/heres-the-upcoming-nexus-superphone-made-by-lg/">that appears to have been bedazzled by a 12-year old</a>. There have also been rumors about <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/15/sony-nexus-x-rumor/">a Nexus flagship made by Sony</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a chance that Google will announce <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/17/yeti-like-32gb-nexus-7-could-join-us-as-soon-as-october-18/">a new range of Nexus 7 tablets</a>, perhaps with a model costing as low as $100 and another with 64GB of storage.</p>
<p>The event happens the Monday after Apple&#8217;s iPad mini event and the launch of Windows 8 and the Microsoft Surface. Intentional timing? You bet. With every announcement, Google is pushing its own branded hardware more than ever before.</p>
