The festivities start at 10:00 and the event will also be live streamed on youtube, seemingly indicating this is a big announcement. The invite sheds little light on the subject matter, but that&#8217;s the date long-rumored for the launch of LG Nexus smartphone. </p>
<p>There have been rumblings for several weeks now concerning the next Nexus smartphone. It&#8217;s reported to be an LG handset and several product shots have leaked out. Very little is known about the hardware, though, besides that it has a backside that appears to have been bedazzled.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a chance that Google will announce a new range of Nexus tablets, perhaps with a model costing as low as $100. </p>
<p>The event follows Apple&#8217;s iPad mini event and the launch of Windows 8 and the Microsoft Surface &#8212; all three happening next week.</p>
