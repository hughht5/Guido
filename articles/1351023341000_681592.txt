<p>All eyes are on the social networking company to show Wall Street some sort of sign of strength in the results from its second quarter as a publicly-traded company. Its stock price lag at around $20 and below for several months now, a significant decline from the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/18/facebook-share-open-10-5-higher-at-42/">$38 per share price</a> it had when it held its closely-watched (and much-criticized) <a href="http://techcrunch.com/tag/facebook-ipo/">initial public offering this past May</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be digging into the company&#8217;s results for the next couple hours, with a careful eye on its mobile traction, as well as sitting in on its call with investors and analysts. But to get started, here are the straight up Q3 numbers and how they compare to Facebook&#8217;s history:</p>
<p>Facebook posted third quarter revenue of $1.26 billion, up nearly seven percent from its <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/26/facebook-q2-2012/">Q2 2012 revenue</a> of $1.18 billion and up 32 percent from the $954 million in revenue it posted in the third quarter of 2011, before it went public. The company&#8217;s third quarter net income on a non-GAAP basis was $372 million, up from the $295 million in non-GAAP net income it posted in Q2 and up from the $227 million in net income it reported a year ago in the third quarter of 2011. This means its non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) was 12 cents.</p>
<p>On a GAAP basis, Facebook posted a loss of $59 million during the third quarter. The major discrepancy between GAAP and non-GAAP here is income taxes and payroll tax adjustments.</p>

Wall Street analysts projected</a> that Facebook would report revenue of $1.23 billion and non-GAAP profit of 11 cents per share, so this report safely surpassed those estimates. The company&#8217;s stock has been perking up over the past couple of days in preparation for the earnings report, and in after-hours trading the stock continued to rally: In the first ten minutes after its Q3 report was published, Facebook stock was up nearly 2.5 percent, to $19.53 per share.</p>
<p>For some visual context, here is a graph showing how Facebook&#8217;s Q3 2012 revenue compares with its history:<br />
