<p>Verizon posted strong Q3 financial results earlier this morning, and pegged much of its success on its strong wireless performance, but how exactly did the carrier&#8217;s smartphone sales break down this past quarter?</p>
<p>In total, Verizon Wireless saw 6.8 million smartphones sold and activated in Q3, with CFO Fran Shammo noting that 3.4 million of them were running Google’s Android operating system. Meanwhile, the carrier activated 3.1 million Apple iPhones in Q3 (up from about 2.7 million iPhones in the previous quarter), and Doherty slyly noted that 21% percent of those devices ran on the carrier’s 4G LTE network.</p>
<p>Well, I wonder what he could be talking about? Since the only device that fits the description is the iPhone 5, that breaks down to about<strong> 615,000 </strong>iPhone 5s sold and activated since the device’s launch in September.</p>
