<p>Every time I see a smart watch I scoff and chortle like an bitter old man watching a gymnast fall on TV. I&#8217;m just not into them.</p>
<p>But the MetaWatch may have just melted my sclerotic heart. Here we see the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/28/move-over-pebble-metawatchs-new-strata-aims-to-make-a-splash-on-kickstarter-too/">Kickstarter project actually do something cool</a>, namely allow users to change widgets on the fly using an <a href="http://techcrunch.com/tag/iphone">iPhone</a> app. Imagine this during a long trip &#8211; you just swap out time zones &#8211; or maybe you&#8217;re waiting for an important message. It seems unutterably valuable and, more important, it seems to work.</p>
<p>Considering that the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/metawatch/metawatch-strata-the-smartwatch-for-the-iphone-4s/posts/298560">MetaWatch</a> is slated to ship very, very soon (they said the last week in September, but obviously that slipped), it will be interesting to see if the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/tag/Pebble">Pebble</a> will be able to keep up. Again, as someone who is very wary of smart watches, I hope that both products win me over when they launch. Someone needs to make a smartwatch and if anyone can do it its these guys.</p>
