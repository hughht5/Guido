<p>No doubt you&#8217;ve already heard about the tragic mess that is Apple&#8217;s iOS 6 Maps. In fact, you&#8217;ve probably already gotten lost on the way to something important thanks to Apple&#8217;s faithful geographical guidance.</p>
<p>But just in case you want to get down to the core issues here, and don&#8217;t feel like wading through <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=techmeme+apple+maps&amp;sugexp=chrome,mod=10&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">article after article</a>, I thought I&#8217;d just tell you about it, to your face.</p>
<p>In short, Apple announced that it was ditching Google Maps with <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/11/apple-announces-ios-6-wwdc/">iOS 6</a>, opting instead to use a homemade offering as the default maps application on iOS devices. Little did we know at the time, but Google actually had <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/9/25/3407614/apple-over-a-year-left-on-google-maps-contract-google-maps-ios-app">a year left on its contract</a> to be the default app for Apple.</p>
<p>Apparently, the relationship disintegrated due to <a target="_blank" href="http://allthingsd.com/20120926/apple-google-maps-talks-crashed-over-voice-guided-directions/">Google&#8217;s unwillingness</a> to relinquish turn-by-turn voice-guided navigation to the Cupertino giant.</p>
<p>In any case, Apple announced that iOS Maps would have turn-by-turn navigation with Siri, transit directions via third-party (semi disguising it as a feature), and a 3D &#8220;Flyover&#8221; mode. It was thrilling, and we couldn&#8217;t wait to play with it ourselves.</p>
<p>Until <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/24/google-maps-app-hacked-onto-iphone-3gs-running-ios-6/">we played with it ourselves</a>.</p>
<p>And we all got lost.</p>
<p>And learned that Berlin was actually called <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/20/welcome-to-apples-ios6-map-where-berlin-is-now-called-schoeneiche/">&#8220;Schoeneiche.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>In essence, it was a very bad day.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, Google mentioned that it wasn&#8217;t going to do anything for the time being, and that it hadn&#8217;t submitted a Google Maps app to the Apple App Store. Officially, Google Chairman Eric Schmidt <a target="_blank" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/25/google-working-on-maps-for-iphone-ipad/">said the following</a>: &#8220;In my opinion it would have been better to retain our maps. It&#8217;s their decision, I&#8217;ll let them describe it.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, in the end, we&#8217;re left with a Map application that we can&#8217;t trust, and no alternative. This has led to the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/26/survey-ios-6-leads-to-decrease-in-device-satisfaction-among-iphone-users/">first ever drop in customer satisfaction</a> from iOS 5 to iOS 6 (in the video, I mixed up iOS 5 and iOS 6, but you catch my drift).</p>
<p>In the meantime, hackers are trying to port over Google&#8217;s iOS 5 maps to iOS 6, but it&#8217;s proven relatively difficult. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/24/google-maps-app-hacked-onto-iphone-3gs-running-ios-6/">Ryan Petrich</a>, however, has made it work, though it&#8217;s still too buggy to release his method to the public.</p>
<p>In related news, the <a target="_blank" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/25/google-working-on-maps-for-iphone-ipad/">NYT reported</a> that Google <em>is</em> in fact working on a Maps app, but that the company wants to take it a step further than mere accuracy: 3D. To do this, much of the Google Maps code would have to be re-written to incorporate Google Earth, an entirely different app.</p>
<p>That means we&#8217;ll be lost for months.</p>
