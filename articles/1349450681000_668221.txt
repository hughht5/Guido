Obvious things first: That&#8217;s clearly an Angry Bird dressed in a Jedi robe and wielding a lightsaber. Got it? Good, cause the rest is a mystery.</p>
<p>Rovio does provide a hint, however, noting that heading to Toys R Us at 8 AM EST (two hours ahead of the 10 AM EST announcement/event/happening/something planned for Times Square) would be a good idea. Toys R Us sells toys, so there&#8217;s a strong possibility we&#8217;ll see some cross-licensing action going on with plush or plastic figures. Lucasfilm is no stranger to licensing, as we&#8217;ve seen with deals with Lego, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/c3bd/?srp=26">Mimobot</a> and many other companies in the past, and there&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/f049/?srp=6">this thing from ThinkGeek</a>, which looks pretty much like it already could be an Angry Birds-branded crossover product.</p>
<p>The real question will be, does this mean we get a Star Wars-themed Angry Birds game, too? Lucasfilm has also licensed its Star Wars properties for use in other iOS games, including Lego titles. There&#8217;s really not much downside for either company, unless one or both of them don&#8217;t like money.</p>
