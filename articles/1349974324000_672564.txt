But as co-founder Walker Williams explains, the two business models are not quite the same. Although Kickstarter also serves as a crowdfunding platform, the production of the item being promoted is up to those raising the funding. At Teespring, however, all production and the shipping are handled by the company itself.</p>
<p>Williams and co-founder Evan Stites-Clayton, recent Brown grads living in Providence, Rhode Island, first happened upon the idea when trying to save a local bar from shutdown. A designer prior to this entrepreneurial venture, Williams threw together a website featuring a &#8220;save the bar&#8221; type of t-shirt, and received a ton of interest from students who wanted to buy one. But when he approached a screen printer for a quote, the cost was steep ($1,500 is a lot for a student!) and the turnaround time was two weeks. He also wasn&#8217;t sure upfront how many shirts and what sizes he would need.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s when he got the idea for what has now become <a target="_blank" href="http://teespring.com/">Teespring</a>. He sat down with Stites-Clayton, a friend and coder, and in five or six hours, they had a website up and running where students could pre-order shirts via PayPal. They had the goal of selling 200 shirts, but they sold 450 and the site saw 3,000 uniques in just a couple of hours. More importantly, the inquires started rolling in via email. Other organizations, on campus and elsewhere, wanted to know: <em>can you build us a website, too</em>?</p>

<p>The two founders started working on Teespring full-time in August 2011, launched their first campaign in January, and opened up into beta in late April. The startup has been flying under the radar, but it&#8217;s grown quite a bit despite the lack of marketing. 1,673 organizers have now used the site to design custom shirts, and since July, they&#8217;ve begun clearing over $100,000 per month. &#8221;We&#8217;ve done over $500,000 in sales and have shipped 27,000 t-shirts to 40 different countries,&#8221; says Williams. &#8220;Every month is our biggest month.&#8221;</p>
<p>The advantage to selling shirts this way isn&#8217;t just the cost savings, it&#8217;s also the quality. &#8220;Previously, if you wanted to print t-shirts, you had two choices,&#8221; Williams explains. &#8220;Either you had to suck it up and pay the $1,000 bill, guesstimate the number of shirts you need, and go through all that hassle with a screenprinter or with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.customink.com/">CustomInk</a>, or you could go to CafePress and there would be no upfront cost.&#8221; But CafePress shirts start at $20 and are digitally printed, he says. &#8220;Digital prints are a low-quality print, the colors aren&#8217;t as vibrant, and they wash out after 20 washes &#8211; it&#8217;s not retail quality.&#8221;</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://teespring.com/">Teespring</a> works with a network of screenprinters to make the shirts, routing customers&#8217; orders to the one nearest them. The company&#8217;s business model involves taking a flat margin per shirt, and customers can turn around and sell those shirts for whatever they want. The site has proved popular with non-profits particularly, looking for other ways to raise money besides asking for donations. $150,000 of Teespring&#8217;s sales have been with non-profit groups, even including some larger organizations like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.planusa.org/">Plan USA</a>.</p>

<p>Now a team of seven, Teespring is a month away from releasing an API and widget that will allow shirt creators to embed campaigns on their own website. They&#8217;re also debating raising a venture round in order to grow further: Williams says he can see the company expanding to anything where it can control production and fulfillment - not just t-shirts and other promotional items. In fact, they&#8217;ve experimented with things like water bottles and hoodies and even snow globes. And they&#8217;ve even received some crazier requests &#8211; like those for surfboards and books.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eventually, we want to be the place where people can crowdfund anything and not worry about the backend,&#8221; says Williams.</p>
<p>Today, the company is nearly profitable. It has $600,000 in angel investment, from local angel <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/bill-cesare/2/490/156">Bill Cesare</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jackierobinson.org/about/MarkWeiner.php">Mark Weiner</a>, who handles Obama&#8217;s merchandising.</p>
