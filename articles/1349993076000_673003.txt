Now, the new Breast Tissue Screening Bra provides women <a target="_blank" href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-57529914-1/how-a-smart-bra-could-one-day-outdo-the-mammogram/?part=rss&amp;subj=crave&amp;tag=title&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+cnet%2FpRza+%28Crave%29">continuous screening in the comfort of their own clothes</a>. In over three clinical trials, the bra correctly identified 92.1 percent of tumors, compared to the 70% accuracy of routine mammograms. More importantly, the bra measures subtle, longitudinal changes in skin temperature that can indicate a tumor as many as 6 years before a traditional screening would detect it (more explanation in the company&#8217;s video below):</p>

<p>Interestingly, in 2009, an influential federal task force recommended that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/16/AR2009111602822.html">women under 40 stop getting routine mammograms</a>, since the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/01/nyt-election-oracle-fivethirtyeight-on-why-blogging-is-great-for-science/">high rate of false positives</a> led too many women to undergo unnecessary treatment. A widely used cancer-detecting bra could increase both the number of tumors detected, but also the false positives, which means that the medical community will have to grapple with this new technology in a responsible way.</p>
<p>First Warning Systems plans to commercialize the BSE bra in Europe in 2013 and, pending FDA approval, in the United States in 2012.</p>
