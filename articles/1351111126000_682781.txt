The company is kicking off a $200 million share repurchasing program. It&#8217;s the first time Zynga has ever done this. </p>
<p>The news comes on the heels of fresh cost-cutting with layoffs for 5 percent of the company&#8217;s workforce and potential closures for international offices in the U.K. and Japan. At the same time, the company just unveiled what could be a big new revenue stream in real-money gaming abroad. The company said it&#8217;s partnering with bwin, a real-money gaming operator, to bring real money casino and poker games to the U.K. </p>
<p>The share buyback program was buried in Zynga&#8217;s third quarter earnings announcement today. The company said it saw revenue of $317 million, which was slightly above the lower range of $300 million to $305 million the company said it would see earlier this month. Bookings came in at $256 million, up 11 percent year-over-year. The company saw a loss of 7 cents per share, and its non-GAAP earnings, which exclude one-off share based compensation costs, were 0 cents per share.</p>
<p>On the casino news and the share buybacks, Zynga&#8217;s shares have climbed 16.5 percent in after-hours trading to $2.47. However, the thing to keep in mind is that share buybacks and layoffs may be short-term moves that only boost the stock price in the near future. Zynga needs to prove success in mobile and casino gaming, third-party game publishing and in diversifying off Facebook onto its own destination site to boost the share price in the long-term. </p>
