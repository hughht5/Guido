The information comes from a &#8220;major Apple investor&#8221; who says he&#8217;s heard it from &#8220;multiple sources.&#8221; Apple has been said to be prepping for the debut of a smaller iPad with a 7.85-inch screen for a while now, and earlier reports suggested October could be when it became official.</p>
<p>Fortune&#8217;s source says that invites are going out on the 10th of October, which might lead to an event a week later if it keeps with tradition, putting a launch event on Oct. 17. Sales could begin within a week of that, if it follows the iPhone 5&#8242;s schedule, meaning it&#8217;ll be on shelves in time for holiday.</p>
<p>Some noteworthy sources have previously reported October could be the month we see the iPad mini, including well-connected <a target="_blank" href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2012/08/23/iphone-5-and-ipad-mini-events/">Apple blogger Jim Dalrymple</a>, who hinted Daring Fireball&#8217;s John Gruber might be right in pegging that month for a launch. Apple never comments on rumors and speculation, but we don&#8217;t have long to wait to find out if this one is true.</p>
