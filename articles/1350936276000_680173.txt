I follow a Twitter account that spits out new jobs in the San Francisco/Valley area, and the last ten tweets have been for Square, and are engineer-related.</p>

<p>None of this should come as a surprise, but the company is definitely narrowing their focus on who they&#8217;d like to bring onto the team, and analytics is a main focus. Makes sense. What&#8217;s interesting though is that the company is looking to hire new grads&#8230;new blood. The company has a &#8220;University Team&#8221; that focuses on these types of recruits.</p>
<p>The company told us that they&#8217;re looking to add 600 jobs in the near future, and it looks like they&#8217;re wasting no time. Peep their <a target="_blank" href="https://squareup.com/jobs">official job page</a> for all open positions.</p>
<p>Smart companies who recruit smart, will win.</p>
