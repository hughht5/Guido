In order to harmonize the product line, the iPad will now come with a Lightning port. A6X and expanded LTE will be added to the iPad as well.</p>
<p>The Lightning port is a good addition for iPhone 5 customers who are going to buy an iPad before the holidays. It will help Apple simplify the product line for accessories and reduce costs related to the supply chain.</p>
<p>Apple surprised us with a couple of other changes. The A6X was added to the iPad as well as expanded LTE support. The company has kept the same design. When it comes to battery, the new A6X system-on-a-chip plays an important role.</p>
<p>As iPhone 5 teardowns have proven, the new A6 is completely redesigned and much more energy efficient. Apple claims that the improved processor and LTE connectivity don&#8217;t come with a drawback, users will have the same 10-hour battery life.</p>
