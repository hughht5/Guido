In order to harmonize the product line, the iPad will now come with a Lightning port. A6X and expanded LTE will be added to the iPad as well.</p>
<p>The Lightning port is a good addition for iPhone 5 customers who are going to buy an iPad before the holidays. It will help Apple simplify the product line for accessories and reduce costs related to the supply chain.</p>
<p>Apple surprised us with a couple of other changes. The A6X was added to the iPad as well as expanded LTE support. The &#8220;X&#8221; means improved graphic capabilities compared to the A6 â€” something needed for the bigger screen. The company has kept the same design and the same price. When it comes to battery, the new A6X system-on-a-chip plays an important role.</p>
<p>As iPhone 5 teardowns have proven, the new A6 is completely redesigned and much more energy efficient. Apple claims that the improved processor and LTE connectivity don&#8217;t come with a drawback, users will enjoy the same 10-hour battery life.</p>
<p>Even though Apple calls it the fourth generation iPad, changes are merely internal upgrades and a new port. The cameras, screen and design remain the same. Yet, Apple makes a smart move right before the holiday season. Those iPads will probably sell well.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether Apple will change its update cycle for that device. The iPad unveiled today may be the sign of a new release cycle with new models coming out every year right before the holiday season.</p>
