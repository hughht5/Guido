An <a target="_blank" href="http://youtube-global.blogspot.ca/2012/10/youtubes-original-channels-go-global.html">announcement</a> on the YouTube blog notes that &#8221;a new generation of original channels&#8221; are launching in France, Germany, the U.K., along with new channels in the U.S. where the original channels push kicked off. <a target="_blank" href="http://allthingsd.com/20121007/youtube-which-wants-more-tv-dollars-pays-up-for-more-channels/">AllThingsD</a> is reporting that more than 60 original channels are being added in the latest round of expansion.</p>
<p>TV production studio Endemol is among <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/yt/advertise/original-channels.html">the new partners</a>, with plans to launch a line-up of channels in France and Germany. Other new channels include HuHu&#8217;s ChannelFlip and The MultiVerse, BBC WorldWide&#8217;s OnEarth, The Jamie Oliver Food Channel and Superfood&#8217;s Mahalo.</p>
<p>&#8220;From local cuisine, health and wellness and parenting to sports, music, comedy, animation and news, this new lineup of original channels will have something for everyone. They are backed by some of the biggest producers, well-known celebrities and emerging media companies from Europe and the U.S.,&#8221; notes Robert Kyncl, VP, Global Head of Content, writing on the YouTube blog.</p>
<p>Last October YouTube <a target="_blank" href="http://youtube-global.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/more-great-content-creators-coming-to.html">announced</a> the launch of around 100 original content channels &#8212; at an estimated cost of <a target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204612504576609101775893100.html">more than $100 million</a>.</p>
<p>According to the YouTube blog, the original channels drive has gathered significant momentum. Kyncl notes that the top 25 original channels are now averaging more than a million views per week, while the number of people subscribing to original channels has doubled year on year.</p>
<p>Another stat flagged up in the blog post is that 800 million YouTube users are now watching four billion hours of original channels content every month, up from three billion hours earlier this year.</p>
<p>Further evidence of accelerated interest in YouTube&#8217;s original channels is that partners are reaching the 100,000 subscriber mark five times faster than they were two years ago, according to Kyncl.</p>
