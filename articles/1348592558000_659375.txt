Despite the potentially limiting name, RIM&#8217;s App World will soon play home to music, movies, and television shows for the company&#8217;s 80 million users to browse and buy.</p>
<p>Naturally, details are still a little light at this point. Mallick noted that consumers would be able to both rent and purchase video content, and that there&#8217;s no streaming to be found here &#8212; all of the media is moved directly onto the device. What&#8217;s more, users will be able to view trending songs or videos to help make that all-important purchasing decision just a little bit easier. All that said, Mallick made no mention of any media partnerships, so exactly what kind of content we&#8217;ll find in the App World is still up in the air.</p>
<p>Developers toting around their Dev Alpha devices (including the fancy new <a target="_blank" href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/25/blackberry-dev-alpha-b-handset-bb10-hands-on/">Dev Alpha B</a>) will see the new-and-improved App World &#8220;immediately,&#8221; though RIM was quick to note that the ability to actually, y&#8217;know, buy things, doesn&#8217;t work just yet.</p>
<p>The RIM employees on-stage let out a joyous yelp at the prospect of &#8220;one stop shopping,&#8221; and with good reason. Rival smartphone players Apple and Google have invested heavily in building up their respective media ecosystems, and RIM clearly doesn&#8217;t want to be left behind this time. Of course, this could all be for naught if RIM doesn&#8217;t wrangle up some strong content partners so we&#8217;ll just have to see what the folks in Waterloo and Hollywood come up with.</p>
