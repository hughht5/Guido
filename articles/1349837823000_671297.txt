But the hardware wasn&#8217;t really <em>the</em> hardware as such – it was a dummy unit with nothing on the inside. But it still showed off some of what the phone will offer users.</p>
<p>The Lumia 810 from T-Mobile comes in both black and cyan variants, and will have a 4.3-inch OLEG WVGA screen that could be very good-looking in practice, one might imagine. There&#8217;s also Windows Phone 8, an 8 megapixel rear camera and a 1.2 megapixel front shooter for Skype and other communication apps, which could take very nice pictures, it&#8217;s reasonable to assume.</p>
<p>What we do know about the 810 is that it feels quite substantial compared to most contemporary smartphones, like in a way that actually isn&#8217;t altogether a good thing. The Lumia 810 could easily use a diet, in fact, and there&#8217;s a lot of space taken up around the not-yet-active screen devoted to bezel. It&#8217;s a bold, aggressive design choice, and one that could result in a chunky chic appeal, but it could also backfire – in a world where thin and light are the name of the game, this is a phone that stands apart, as you can see by the side-by-side shots with it and the iPhone 5.</p>
<p>Microsoft clearly doesn&#8217;t want anyone touching the Windows 8 software before it unveils it later this month. We&#8217;ll see what the 810, and its bigger brother the 920 delivers when Windows 8 finally ships.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> This device apparently has internals that could theoretically work, according to T-Mo, but in the end it might as well not, since no one who touched it to actually interact with its software or view it running.</p>
