<p>Megaupload will not be stopped. After a dramatic take-down followed by an anticlimactic trial, Kim Dotcom is quickly rebuilding the Megaupload empire. <a target="_blank" href="http://torrentfreak.com/megaupload-readies-for-comeback-code-90-done-120923/">TorrentFreak recently detailed</a> the relaunch, stating the coding is nearly done, the servers are ordered and Kim Dotcom is prepared to come back with a vengeance. </p>
<p>Now Kim Dotcom released the video above teasing the launch of Megabox. This is Megaupload&#8217;s long-talked about music locker service and perhaps <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/24/was-megaupload-targeted-because-of-its-upcoming-megabox-digital-jukebox-service/">the reason Dotcom was targeted so harshly</a>. &#8220;This is what they don&#8217;t want you to have. Unchaining artists and fans. Megabox is coming soon,&#8221; says the YouTube description. And if the little LEGO Android statue shown is any indication, Megabox is likely built heavily for mobile. </p>
<p>Dotcom previously revealed that Megabox will allow artists to sell music directly to fans, keeping 90% of the profits. It&#8217;s unclear if that&#8217;s still the case, but it&#8217;s probably a safe bet that Dotcom and the rest of the Megaupload world are prepping Megabox to be the anti-RIAA and as pro-artist/fans as possible. And that&#8217;s awesome.</p>
