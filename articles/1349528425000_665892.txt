<p>Makerbot has released their <a target="_blank" href="http://makerbot.com/">Replicator 2</a>. Form 1 sought to Kickstart $100,000 for their professional 3D printer; they&#8217;re at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/formlabs/form-1-an-affordable-professional-3d-printer">$1.5 million and counting</a>. Panda Robotics just launched a Kickstarter for their <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pandarobotics/pandabot-a-friendly-affordable-3d-printer">open-source PandaBot printer</a>. The authorities are <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/smartnews/2012/10/its-all-fun-and-games-until-someone-3d-prints-a-gun/">cracking down</a> on 3D-printed guns. John Biggs <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/02/home-3d-printing-is-killing-the-manufacturing-industry/">argues</a> that home 3D printing is killing the manufacturing industry.</p>
<p>I <a target="_blank" href="http://www.snopes.com/quotes/kenolsen.asp">respectfully disagree</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, I agree that 3D printing will be a serious threat to manufacturing as we know it. But not at home. That doesn&#8217;t make sense. Instead, we&#8217;ll have two kinds of communal 3D printer shops.</p>
<p>In high-infrastructure areas, there&#8217;ll be a clutch of online providers a la <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/10/stratasys-followup/">Stratasys</a> (and I expect one of them to be Amazon.com): you&#8217;ll pick your 3D design from a huge online menu, send them size information and maybe a few photos from some kind of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.trimensional.com/">cunningly</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/11/amazing-software-turns-cheap-webcam-into-instant-3d-scanner/">designed</a> app, tweak the 3D preview until you&#8217;re happy, and they&#8217;ll print it out in some vast warehouse full of high-end high-speed 3D printers and ship it to you, possibly<a target="_blank" href="http://www.sfgate.com/technology/dotcommentary/article/Amazon-same-day-delivery-rumored-3702936.php"> that same day</a>.</p>
<p>In low-infrastructure areas, or if you&#8217;re a casual hobbyist, or if you have very specific requirements, you&#8217;ll head down the road to your nearest local printing facility. Depending on where you are, maybe this is tomorrow&#8217;s TechShop, maybe it&#8217;s a cluster of <a target="_blank" href="http://gizmodo.com/5942294/the-next-industrial-revolution-starts-in-a-20+foot-shipping-container">converted shipping containers</a> on the outskirts of Uganda each with their own specialties and strengths. They&#8217;ll customize your order, render it <a target="_blank" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/29/cloud-computing-for-the-poorest-countries/">in the cloud</a> as needed, print it out, and tweak and iterate until it&#8217;s done. More expensive but more specific.</p>
<p>(Nomenclature note: Until recently, I would have used &#8220;developed world&#8221; and &#8220;developing world&#8221; rather than &#8220;high-infrastructure&#8221; and &#8220;low-infrastructure.&#8221; However, now that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/commentary/the-poor-aint-what-they-used-to-be/article4575748/">the vast majority of the world&#8217;s poorest people do not live in poor countries</a>, I&#8217;m not sure the first two phrases are meaningful any more.)</p>
<p>But you won&#8217;t see many home printers outside of passionate artists/hobbyists and home manufacturing businesses. At least not for a very long while. It just doesn&#8217;t make economic sense.</p>
<p>Do I sound like a skeptic? Not at all; I&#8217;m an idealist. I&#8217;m saying that custom 3D printing is going to be too important to be a home-hobbyist endeavour: instead it will explode from a hacker novelty to a fundamental part of our collective economic infrastructure. In the high-infrastructure world, this will provide new economic efficiencies, open up new market segments, and create a scaffolding for a lot of elaborate and fantastic new art. In the low-infrastructure poor world, though, it&#8217;s going to be a lot more important than that. There I think it might be something akin to an economic revolution. Yes, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/09/feature-phones-are-not-the-future/">another</a> one. Buckle your seat belts: it&#8217;s going to be an interesting decade.</p>
<p>(In slightly related news, I&#8217;ll be filing tech dispatches from Cambodia, Thailand, and hopefully Burma over the next few weeks. Don&#8217;t touch that dial.)</p>
