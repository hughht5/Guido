<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.zynga.com">Zynga</a> announced today its first move into online casino gaming, in other words, gambling-oriented games that deal with real money.</p>
<p>Zynga <a target="_blank" href="http://investor.zynga.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=716059">announced this afternoon</a> it has inked an exclusive partnership with bwin.party, the Gibraltar-based online gambling company, to offer real money online poker and casino games in the United Kingdom, where such things are currently legal (they are not permitted in the United States.) Through the new partnership, Zynga&#8217;s UK arm and bwin.party will launch products including poker and 180 other casino games such as slots, roulette, and blackjack &#8220;in the first half of 2013.&#8221; Financial terms of the partnership have not been disclosed.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not news that Zynga has been building a strategy to expand into real money games. Earlier this year in Zynga&#8217;s second quarter earnings call, CEO Mark Pincus told analysts and investors that the company <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/25/zynga-gambling-2013/">was on track to launch real-money games</a> in the first half of 2013, so this squares up with that timing. Last month the company <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-13/zynga-hires-online-gambling-executive-in-real-money-gaming-push.html">hired former online gambling exec Maytal Olsha</a> to serve as its &#8220;chief operating officer of new markets,&#8221; in effect to lead its push into games that deal in real money. </p>
<p>This is big news, and it will be very interesting to see how it impacts the investor reception of its <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/24/zynga-reports-third-quarter-revenue-of-317m-shares-pop-12-7-in-after-hours/">third quarter results announced this afternoon</a>. Zynga&#8217;s stock price has been lagging around <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/05/more-competitors-smarter-gamers-expensive-ads-less-virality-mobile/">record lows</a> for weeks, and yesterday the company <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/23/zynga-ceo-mark-pincus-confirms-layoffs-5-of-workforce-potential-closures-for-u-k-japan-offices/">cut five percent of its workforce</a> as part of a move to cut a number of social gaming titles that have not gotten strong user traction. Making its long-anticipated launch into real money games could give Zynga a much-needed shot in the arm &#8212; although, to be sure, real gambling is certainly a more controversial industry than making social games with cute farm animals.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be updating this story, but for now here is the press release:</p>
<blockquote><p>
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 24, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) &#8212; Zynga (Nasdaq:ZNGA), the world&#8217;s leading provider of social game services, and bwin.party, the leading international real money gaming operator, today announced an exclusive partnership to offer real money online Poker and Casino games in the UK market.
