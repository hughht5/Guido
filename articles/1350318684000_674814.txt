The roadshow, which involves several day-long events across various cities worldwide, is meant to encourage both new and experienced developers to build apps that take advantage of the Facebook platform in some way. In addition to the hackathon portion of World HACK, Facebook also begins each event with technical sessions focused on things like Open Graph, iOS, Android, mobile web and more.</p>
<p>Facebook staff also offers demos and sample code to help developers get started, and is available throughout the day to offer hands-on support.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/15/facebook-announces-three-grand-prize-winners-from-world-hack-competition/emea2/" rel="attachment wp-att-674838"></a>This year, the World HACK roadshow hit up Austin, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Sao Paulo, Berlin, Taipei, Jakarta, Bangalore, Barcelona, Vancouver, Warsaw and Moscow, and saw over 2,000 developers participate in total. By the end of the tour, over 330 demos had been created, representing 16,000+ hours of work. Facebook also announced new <a target="_blank" href="http://facebook-developers.meetup.com/">meetup groups</a> in several cities during the event, in order to maintain developer momentum even after World HACK wrapped.</p>
<p>The apps built focused on a variety of subjects, including games, music, cooking and philanthropy. Some even included hardware like Arduino and an iron (yes, like the kind you use on clothes!).</p>
<p>Three Grand Prize winners were chosen, whose creators won a trip to Facebook HQ in Menlo Park, where they&#8217;ll now get to meet with Facebook engineering team members. These winners include the following (via Facebook&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2012/10/15/world-hack-recap-and-winners/">blog post</a>):</p>
