A <a target="_blank" href="http://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000155972012000002/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">Form D</a> filed with the SEC today shows that it&#8217;s now raised north of that: $117 million (or $117,051,696, to be exact).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear from the document whether the round includes any new investors, although the <a target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB10000872396390443684104578066811794775602-lMyQjAxMTAyMDEwOTAxODk3Wj.html">WSJ</a> reported last week that Peter Thiel could be investing up to $150 million in the company. <strong>Update</strong>: We have been hearing that Peter Thiel <em>is</em>, in fact, among the investors, and that the $150 million figure is correct. In other words, Airbnb has filed a Form D for only part of this investment round. We&#8217;ve also heard that the total round will be $200 million. We&#8217;re still looking into whether Thiel&#8217;s $150 million will come from Thiel, his Founders Fund investment firm, or a combination of the two. [original article continues below]</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/airbnb">Previous backers</a> of the company include Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, Crunch Fund, Ashton Kutcher and more. The Form D lists Greg McAdoo from Sequoia and Jeff Jordan from Andreessen Horowitz as two of its directors.</p>
<p>When we first reported the news of the newest round, we had said that it would value the company at between $2 billion and $3 billion.</p>
<p>If correct, that could quite possibly make Airbnb the most valuable of the collaborative consumption / &#8220;sharing economy&#8221; companies out there, and almost certainly the most valuable one focused on accommodation.</p>
<p>Separately, Airbnb filed a <a target="_blank" href="http://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000155972012000003/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">second Form D</a> that noted a raise of just under $1.6 million made earlier in the year. Both are a mixture of debt and equity filings.</p>
<p>Airbnb has raised over $230 million to date.</p>
<p>In June, the company reported that it had taken 10 million bookings worldwide for room and house sharing on its site to date. The company takes a 10% commission on each booking that&#8217;s made there.</p>
<p>The company has not disclosed revenues publicly, and hasn&#8217;t talked about what the average price for a night&#8217;s stay is, but if the average rates are between <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/26/airbnb-is-raising-a-big-third-round-aiming-for-a-valuation-north-of-2b/">$70</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.reuters.com/small-business/2011/07/01/is-airbnb-growing-too-fast/">$100</a>, that could point to revenues of between $168 million and $240 million.</p>
<p>More to come. Refresh for updates.</p>
