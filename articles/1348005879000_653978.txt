When men outnumber women, groups who strive towards consensus decisions, rather than majority rule, see greater female participation. &#8220;Unanimous rule protects minority women, and under this decision rule they take up their equal share of the conversation,&#8221; explains <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/09/120918121257.htm?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+sciencedaily+%28ScienceDaily%3A+Latest+Science+News%29">a new study</a> in Political Science&#8217;s preeminent, journal, <em>The American Political Science Review</em>. For those organizations that have bought into the premise that females add valuable perspectives, this new research is a simple way to solve a perennial issue.</p>
<p>The experiment randomly assigned different proportions of men and women into deliberative groups, charged with figuring out how to allocate financial rewards to each member based on hypothetical work tasks [<a target="_blank" href="http://leeshaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Gender-Inequality-in-Deliberative-Participation-APSR-2012.pdf">pdf</a>]. The researchers coded how often women spoke compared to men and whether their peers judged them as &#8220;influential&#8221; in post-activity surveys.</p>
<p>When groups decide how to allocate money by majority rule, and there&#8217;s only one woman in the group, the one woman contributes less than half of her share of the conversation, compared to the men. Under consensus rule-making, that proportion jumps about 50 percent, garnering near equal participation from men and women.</p>
<p>&#8220;Under unanimity, no voice can be overlooked because every vote is pivotal,&#8221; they write. &#8220;This rule helps minorities by elevating their level of participation.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the gender disparity is not entirely a function of being outnumbered. Women, by genetic or cultural factors, behave differently in groups. &#8220;In small group discussion, on average men tend toward individual agency, women toward cooperation&#8230;Therefore, women in a numerical minority may interpret unanimous rule to mean that they should make at least a minimal contribution, more than they do in majority rule, but avoid dominating the discussion.</p>
<p>Interestingly, under more female influence, the allocation of money is also more egalitarian, offering more money to the least among their peers. The study&#8217;s results seem to have analogues in the real world: After Norway adopted gender quota laws for public companies, one study found that greater female leadership resulted in less workforce reductions [<a target="_blank" href="http://economics.mit.edu/files/6500">pdf</a>].</p>
<p>I suspect not all of our readers agree with the premise that women should be proactively included in decision-making. But, for those who do, this research could have immediate benefits.</p>
