If you&#8217;re going to the North Country Fair where the wind hits heavy on Lake Michigan, we want you to attend one of our TC Northern meetups to be held in <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://techcrunchtorontomeetup.eventbrite.com">Toronto</a> on November 5, <a target="_blank" href="http://techcrunchmeetupdetroit.eventbrite.com">Detroit</a> on November 7, and <a target="_blank" href="http://techcrunchchicagomeetup.eventbrite.com">Chicago</a> on November 9</strong>. That&#8217;s right: we&#8217;re bringing the magic of our <a href="http://techcrunch.com/tag/southeast-meetup/">Southeast Meetups</a> to Hogtown, Motor City, and the City in a Garden and we&#8217;d love to see you there.</p>
<p>We have great venues in each city: The Steam Whistle in Toronto, Hockeytown Cafe in Detroit and Zhou B Art Center in Chicago. Along with the massive meetups, we are also holding office hours in each city &#8212; more on this later. And of course there is no cost to these events but space is limited. Just come out, have some free drinks thanks to our sponsors and talk startups with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to sponsor one or all of these fantastic gatherings, or know someone that should, shoot a message to our amazing sponsorship team <a target="_blank" href="mailto:sponsors@techcrunch.com">here</a>. </p>
<p>We&#8217;re planning on driving from Toronto down to Chicago so it should be quite a hoot. If the Southeast meetups were any indication, these will be outright amazing and we&#8217;re really looking forward to seeing you guys. Watch this space for more information and get ready &#8211; this is going to be fun.</p>
