We&#8217;ve learned that its Co-Founder Frank Speiser has stepped down from the CEO position to make way for now former Managing Director of North Sea Partners, Missy Godfrey.</p>

<blockquote><p>The reason why I was so excited to come on board is because the market has caught up to the mission of SocialFlow. The company had the foresight to understand that the brands and publishers would have a better understanding of what the need would be for social media. The answer to &#8220;what is social media?&#8221; is &#8220;what can it do for you?&#8221; We have a platform that has complex data mining and processing to sort through what&#8217;s going on through all of the noise. We give you the lever to react to what&#8217;s going on in real-time. The timing was right to come in, the product is ready for what the market needs. The market is now screaming for this.</p></blockquote>
<p>Speiser spent over three years at the helm of the company, but it appears that it was time for new leadership to be brought in. The company has raised $7M in funding as a Betaworks company, and its A round of financing included Softbank Capital, AOL Ventures, and SV Angel.  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.socialflow.com/company/leadership">According to its website</a>, Speiser is now the acting President and Chief Product Office of the company. Godfrey shared:</p>
<blockquote><p>Frank is a brilliant product guy, and he has done an exceptional job of bringing in paying clients to show our proof of concept. He suggested to the board that they consider bringing me in. We have a great relationship and he&#8217;s so happy to be working on product again.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s a bit of Godfrey&#8217;s bio from SocialFlow&#8217;s leadership page:</p>
<blockquote><p>Missy Godfrey is a senior operating executive and general manager with a distinguished track record spanning over two decades in multiple diverse sectors, including traditional and digital media, luxury goods, advertising, private equity investing, and wealth management.  She is an expert in the planning and execution of turnarounds, product launches and start-up growth initiatives.</p></blockquote>
<p>It sounds like Godfrey&#8217;s extensive experience in media will be a huge asset for SocialFlow as it moves forward in trailblazing the tracking of digital mentions and engagement with its &#8220;SocialFlow AttentionScore&#8221; technology.</p>
