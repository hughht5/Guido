YouTube&#8217;s analytics now, for example, put a stronger emphasis on audience engagement and allow publishers to see an estimate of how many minutes a video was watched in total.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/?attachment_id=672636" rel="attachment wp-att-672636"></a>Another new feature the company is launching is a beta version of its annotations report. With this, publishers can see a detailed breakdown of click-through rates and close rates for their annotations. According to Google, &#8220;annotations are one of the most used features to drive audience engagement in YouTube&#8221; and this new analytics data should help publishers optimize them for their audiences.</p>
<p>Another feature YouTube power users will appreciate is the service&#8217;s new-found ability to compare trends and patterns across two different metrics.</p>
<p>With this update, YouTube is also introducing a few small design changes to Analytics, including an easier to use data slider for selecting date ranges, as well as video hovercards that allow you to see a thumbnail of your video and some basic information about it when you hover over a link.</p>
<p>Google <a target="_blank" href="http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2011/11/announcing-youtube-analytics-next.html">launched</a> the current incarnation of YouTube Analytics, which replaces YouTube Insight, last November.</p>
