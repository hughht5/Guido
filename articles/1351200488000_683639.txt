<p>During the Q4 2012 earnings call today, Tim Cook fielded a question regarding the upcoming strong financial push that Apple will be making this holiday season. As you know, Apple had a strong Q4 and has just re-launched its complete lineup of products. It&#8217;s before Christmas, so someone is getting goodies in their stockings their year.</p>
<p>Cook said that customers are delighted with Apple products because of its focus on design, and clearly stated that it doesn&#8217;t &#8220;cut corners.&#8221; This is probably a stab at Samsung, who has <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/24/apple-wins-patent-ruling-as-jury-finds-samsung-infringes/">lost its court battle against Apple</a> due to lifting some of the major components of the iPhone&#8217;s success.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a surprise that Apple is dedicated to creating the &#8220;best in class&#8221; when it comes to devices, just look at this video about the iPad mini featuring <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/23/ipad-mini-jony-ive-video/">Jony Ive</a>:</p>
