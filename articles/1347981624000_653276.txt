<p>The software doesn&#8217;t analyse the image itself &#8212; those abilities will be coming in later tools &#8212; but rather sifts through the file metadata to determine whether it matches the original image capture.</p>
<p>Playing around with the veracity of images &#8212; to make it look like you&#8217;re <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/28/talented-shirley-hornstein/">best buddies with Justin Timberlake</a>, say, or to <a target="_blank" href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/10/in-an-iranian-image-a-missile-too-many/">add one more missile</a> than you actually have in your arsenal &#8212; has of course never been easier (although fake photos are pretty much as old as cameras, as Fourandsix&#8217;s fascinating <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fourandsix.com/photo-tampering-history/">Photo Tampering Gallery</a> underlines).</p>
<p>The startup, which is currently self-funded, sees a market for its fake flagging software in law enforcement &#8212; combating crimes such as child exploitation &#8212; and for legal professionals.</p>
<p>&#8220;Establishing the veracity of images allows law enforcement to focus its limited resources on investigating crimes against children on the Internet,&#8221; noted Michelle Collins, Vice President of the Exploited Children Division at the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children, in a supporting statement.</p>
<p>FourMatch is available immediately via the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fourandsix.com/">company&#8217;s website</a> &#8211; and is being priced at $890. A company spokesman told me Fourandsix plans to develop a suite of products &#8212; including tools that will be able to flag up evidence of photo-editing or &#8220;subtle errors in realism&#8221;.</p>
<p>Fourandsix was co-founded last year by Kevin Connor, the former VP of product management of  Adobe&#8217;s Photoshop team, and image forensics scientist Hany Farid who has been conducting research into image manipulation for around a decade.</p>
