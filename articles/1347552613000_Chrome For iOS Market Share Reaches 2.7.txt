By mid-July, Google&#8217;s browser for Apple&#8217;s mobile operating system had managed to get about 1.5% of the market and has been adding new users ever since, despite the fact that Apple makes it very hard for its users to switch browsers. Now, according to the <a target="_blank" href="http://insights.chitika.com/2012/chromeiosupdate/">latest data</a> from online advertising service <a target="_blank" href="http://chitika.com">Chitika</a>, Chrome for iOS drives 2.7% of all iOS web traffic to the sites in its network. Depending on the hour of the day, says Chitika, traffic from Chrome for iOS is often above 5% and peaked at 6.83% on September 7.</p>
<p>Obviously, Chrome for iOS is not a huge hit and Chitika&#8217;s analysts note that &#8220;considering the fact that Chrome for iOS spent nearly a month as the top free app for iOS devices, the Chitika Insights team expected it would make more of an impact on the market than it has thus far.&#8221;</p>

<p>One thing Google has going for it in terms of getting a bit more market share is that it recently added an &#8220;open in Chrome&#8221; feature to its Gmail and Google+ apps for iOS. Other apps, including the now <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/20/google-acquires-iosmac-email-client-sparrow/">Google-owned</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/sparrow/id492573565?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Sparrow for iPhone</a> offer a similar feature.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unlikely that Apple will give users the option to make a third-party browser the default browser on iOS anytime soon. Still, almost 15% of all the iOS web traffic to Chitika&#8217;s network comes from third-party browsers.</p>
