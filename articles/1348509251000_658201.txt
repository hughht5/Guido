<p>TechCrunch has investigated, and we have found no evidence that the allegedly exposed posts were actually private messages. Their email receipts show they were in fact wall posts, and the posts do not appear in users&#8217; Facebook Messages inbox. </p>
<p>Facebook also says in no uncertain terms that there is absolutely no privacy bug. What people are seeing are old Wall postings, not private messages. A spokesperson tells TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Every report we&#8217;ve seen, we&#8217;ve gone back and checked. We haven&#8217;t seen one report that&#8217;s been confirmed [of a private message being exposed]. A lot of the confusion is because before 2009 there were no likes and no comments on wall posts. People went back and forth with wall posts instead of having a conversation [in the comments of single wall post.]</p>
<p>A small number of users raised concerns after what they mistakenly believed to be private messages appeared on their Timeline. Our engineers investigated these reports and found that the messages were older wall posts that had always been visible on the users&#8217; profile pages. Facebook is satisfied that there has been no breach of user privacy.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>We first heard reports of this through emails this morning from readers. Reports of this supposed issue were first published in French newspapers such as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lemonde.fr/technologies/article/2012/09/24/messages-prives-rendus-publics-et-plongeon-boursier-pour-facebook_1765038_651865.html"><em>Le Monde</em>,</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lematin.ch/high-tech/web/Facebook-publie-les-messages-prives-des-membres/story/11015793"><em>Le Matin</em></a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;prev=_t&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;twu=1&amp;u=http://www.metrofrance.com/high-tech/facebook-d-anciens-messages-prives-publies-sur-la-timeline/mlix!MDk3LU0hjxIQ/&amp;usg=ALkJrhiss0HsNxWyk-4YIdSV9Uaa0aPrjA"><em>Metro France</em></a>.</p>
<p>The reason that this became an issue today may be because of Timeline&#8217;s global rollout. The first cases of people being worried about the potential exposure of old messages came from France &#8212; a Facebook spokesperson says this is the most recent place that Timeline was pushed to all users. </p>
