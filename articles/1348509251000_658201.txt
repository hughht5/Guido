<p>We first heard reports of this through emails this morning from readers. Personally, I am seeing the issue &#8212; I am currently seeing private messages on my friends&#8217; Timelines. My own Timeline also now is showing direct messages sent to me from 2009 and earlier as wall posts. Not all users, however, are seeing the bug.</p>
<p>The issue appears to be showing up both here in the United States as well as internationally. Reports of this have been been published in French newspapers such as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lemonde.fr/technologies/article/2012/09/24/messages-prives-rendus-publics-et-plongeon-boursier-pour-facebook_1765038_651865.html"><em>Le Monde</em>,</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lematin.ch/high-tech/web/Facebook-publie-les-messages-prives-des-membres/story/11015793"><em>Le Matin</em></a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;prev=_t&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;twu=1&amp;u=http://www.metrofrance.com/high-tech/facebook-d-anciens-messages-prives-publies-sur-la-timeline/mlix!MDk3LU0hjxIQ/&amp;usg=ALkJrhiss0HsNxWyk-4YIdSV9Uaa0aPrjA"><em>Metro France</em></a>.</p>
<p>This is just breaking, so this post will be updated as more information becomes available.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> A Facebook spokesperson responded via email with the following message:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;A small number of users raised concerns after what they mistakenly believed to be private messages appeared on their Timeline. Our engineers investigated these reports and found that the messages were older wall posts that had always been visible on the users&#8217; profile pages. Facebook is satisfied that there has been no breach of user privacy.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem to be quite satisfactory to me, since I personally continue to see what were direct messages on both my own and my friends&#8217; Timelines. Below is a screenshot of what I can currently see on a friend&#8217;s wall; I&#8217;ve confirmed with her that these were private messages sent directly to her, not wall posts.</p>

<p>I have responded to the spokesperson with screenshots of these instances, including what appears to be a personal and direct &#8220;Happy holidays to you too! Have fun skiing&#8230;&#8221; note written by Mark Zuckerberg in 2008 that is now showing up on Path founder Dave Morin&#8217;s Timeline (I&#8217;ve embedded an image of that exchange below.) </p>
