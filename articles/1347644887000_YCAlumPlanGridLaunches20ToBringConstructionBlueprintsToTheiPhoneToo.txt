<a target="_blank" href="http://www.plangrid.com">PlanGrid</a> co-founder and CEO <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/ryan-sutton-gee">Ryan Sutton-Gee</a> doesn&#8217;t exactly fit the mold you might expect from the founder of a San Francisco-based that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/27/yc-demo-day-session-1/">recently graduated</a> from the super selective <a target="_blank" href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a> incubator. Sure, he&#8217;s young and super smart. But when you meet him, he&#8217;s not really up on the latest inside baseball Silicon Valley chatter &#8212; what startup is raising at a crazy high valuation, which entrepreneur recently Tweeted something juicy, the latest leaked memo from a senior executive. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s because when he <a target="_blank" href="http://plangrid.com/about">and his team</a> are not knee-deep in coding their <a target="_blank" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/plangrid-construction-plans/id498795789?mt=8">app</a>, which debuted this past spring <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/02/plangrid-builds-a-new-market-for-the-ipad-the-construction-industry/">bringing full-resolution blueprints to the iPad</a>, they&#8217;re out talking to folks who move in a completely different realm than the target audience of most early-stage apps: Construction.</p>
<p>That focus on their customers has paid off so far. PlanGrid, which has raised <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/29/plangrid-ipad-construction-seed-funding-bo/">$1.1 million in seed funding</a> from a bevy of big-name investors, already has paying customers at major construction sites nationwide, from a brand new California hospital to a major urban center&#8217;s new transit complex. </p>
<p>And this week, the company rolled out <a target="_blank" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/plangrid-construction-plans/id498795789?mt=8">version 2.0 of its app</a>, which is now optimized for both the iPad and the iPhone. PlanGrid 2.0 also has a handful of clever new features, such as the ability to add photos to the blueprint documents to monitor a project&#8217;s evolution over time.</p>
<p>Since it&#8217;s such a visual product, Ryan Sutton-Gee stopped by TechCrunch TV to give us an in-person demo of PlanGrid 2.0 and talk a bit about the company&#8217;s growth. Watch the video embedded above to see PlanGrid in action, and look below to see screenshots of PlanGrid 2.0 on the iPhone and the iPad (click to enlarge):</p>
