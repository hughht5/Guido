Not only was this a nice addition for Google+, but it finally utilized <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/13/google-acquiring-frommers-travel-brand-more-google-improvements-likely-to-follow/">Google&#8217;s acquisition of Zagat</a>. Having said that, I haven&#8217;t used the service all that much, because there are some usability issues there.</p>
<p>The team seems to be working on some of those issues and rolled out some changes to how it asks you to rate a restaurant, for example. Rating systems are a pain, because you never really know what to say. For a 1 to 5 system, I often ask myself &#8220;is 5 really super awesome, or just good enough?&#8221; These are things that cloud these final ratings, making them not so useful for those who come along and read them.</p>
<p>Google has decided to get rid of the number system for reviewing a venue and replaced it with a scale &#8212; ranging from poor to excellent &#8212; that makes a bit more sense. Google will then do the heavy lifting on calculating a useful score.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what Megan Stevenson from Google <a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/102954688457300330092/posts/LwbTUPxGdsy">had to say about the changes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today it’s easier than ever to write accurate, useful reviews on Google+ Local, thanks to the updated rating scale we rolled out. If you want to rate the food at a restaurant, or the quality of a mechanic, just choose &#8220;poor &#8211; fair,&#8221; “good,” “very good,” or &#8220;excellent&#8221;. Behind the scenes, we’ll convert your ratings into numbers and factor them into the business&#8217; precise 30-point score that shows up in Google+, Search and Maps.</p>
<p>Give it a try! Click on the Google+ Local icon in the left navigation bar, search for a local spot and click &#8220;Write a review.” Happy reviewing!</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m really fascinated with sentiment analysis, and unfortunately there&#8217;s no way to really find out how people &#8220;feel&#8221; about something when you&#8217;re interfacing with the Internet. However, companies like Path do a really great job of that by offering up things like smiley faces and hearts. While Google isn&#8217;t going that route, I think that this is a huge upgrade:</p>

<p>The other nice recent addition is that you can <a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/106226439354629484339/posts/d7SGrFNhfDj">see reviews that your friends have made</a> by visiting their profile. It&#8217;s something that the team removed, but it has returned, luckily.</p>

<p>Seeing reviews that others have left, if they want to expose that, is a great way to find new places to check out, and also plants the seed that you should also review a place to help the next person out.</p>
<p>As far as ratings, or basically everything really, I don&#8217;t think in numbers, and I am more likely to rate a place that I&#8217;ve eaten at when presented with actual words to express my feelings. Unfortunately, there&#8217;s no option for &#8220;absolute suckage,&#8221; which is a phrase that I tend to use to explain a really bad experience.</p>
<p>Oh well, maybe next time.</p>
