Tied to its UK launch, the startup says it&#8217;s also releasing version 3.0 of the service.</p>
<p>Now, I usually spend my lunches frantically cramming down food while writing posts or doing briefings, but if yours are a little less hectic, you might want to use LetsLunch to get some networking mileage out of those lunch breaks. (And I&#8217;m sure some of you think that&#8217;s a terrifying idea, but hey, it&#8217;s not for everyone.) The startup, which came out of the Founders Institute,  <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/31/letslunch-launches-and-weve-got-100-invites/">basically facilitates that process by serving as a professional matchmaking service</a>.</p>
<p>When you sign up for LetsLunch, you create a social profile, enter your interests, and identify when you&#8217;d like to have networking lunches. Then the site will match you up with other users, and you&#8217;ll get an email asking you to confirm the meal and choose the restaurant. You can also browse other users&#8217; profiles and invite them to lunch. After the Lunch, you&#8217;re asked to answer questions about the experience, so that the site can further refine its matches.</p>
<p>As for version 3.0, founder and CEO Syed Shuttari let me play with a test version of the revamped site. The most interesting new feature is probably the ability to become a &#8220;sponsored luncher&#8221; — basically, you&#8217;re paying to be featured in the upper right corner of the site, in the hopes that more people will have lunch with you. Other additions include a smart widget for job recruiters, the ability to invite friends from Facebook and other social networks, revamped navigation, and &#8220;smart group lunches.&#8221;</p>
<p>Interested folks in the UK can sign up for LetsLunch by going to the site and selecting the UK flag, or you can just <a target="_blank" href="http://letslunch.com/coming-to-uk">follow this link</a>.
