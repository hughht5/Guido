Samsung has now confirmed it has patched the flaw for its flagship Galaxy SIII handset.</p>
<p>Samsung is urging Galaxy SIII owners to update to the latest version of its software to ensure they are protected against the flaw. Here&#8217;s Samsung&#8217;s official statement:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We would like to assure our customers that the recent security issue concerning the GALAXY S III </em><em>has already been resolved through a software update. </em><em>We recommend all GALAXY S III customers to download the latest software update, which can be done </em><em>quickly and easily via the Over-The-Air (OTA) service.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Handsets vulnerable to the exploit also included the Galaxy S II series, the Galaxy S Advance, Galaxy Beam, and Galaxy Ace.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re asking Samsung to confirm whether it has released patches for all affected handsets.</p>
<p>The flaw can also be triggered by scanning a malicious QR code.</p>
<p>The problem apparently lies with how Samsung&#8217;s TouchWiz dialer handles USSD codes, and also how the stock browser handles the &#8220;tel:&#8221; protocol handler.</p>
<p>The flaw came to light at a recent security conference in Argentina, demoed by Technical University Berlin researcher Ravi Borgaonkar.</p>
