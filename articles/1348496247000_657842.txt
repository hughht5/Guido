<p>The rankings, from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120924005299/en/Ace-Metrix-Reviews-Top-Tablet-Ads-Year">ad analytics company Ace Metrix</a> &#8211; a startup backed by Hummer Winblad Venture Partners, Palomar Ventures, Leapfrog Ventures, and WPP &#8211; say they determine an ad&#8217;s &#8220;Ace Score&#8221; based on viewer reaction to national TV ads in which consumers are asked to rate ads &#8220;on a scale of 1-950, which represents scoring on creative attributes such as relevance, persuasion, watchability, information, attention, etc.&#8221; Respondents, it says, are randomly selected.</p>
<p>Samsung takes the lead six out of the top-10 tablet ads, with Google&#8217;s newly-launched Nexus taking two slots and Amazon&#8217;s Kindle Fire, also seeing recent launches, taking up two more. Here&#8217;s how the advertising rankings stack up:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The ranking seems particularly ironic in light of how tablets actually appear to be selling at the moment.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/18/opa-ios-and-android-level-in-u-s-tablet-market-penetration-47-by-2013-2-6b-spent-on-apps-in-2012/">Online Publishers Association in June</a> gave Apple a market share of 52% collectively for the three versions of the iPad that have been released so far, with the iPad 2 at the top of the pile. Android collectively has a 47% share, with the Kindle Fire (forked Android as it is&#8230;) with a 28% share.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As a point of comparison, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/25/24-9m-tablets-sold-in-q2-with-apples-share-of-that-now-over-68-says-strategy-analytics/">Strategy Analytics</a> gave Apple an even bigger margin of the market for the last quarter. In July, it said that Apple accounted for over 68% of all tablets sold, with Android at under 30%.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Apple is also topping the charts for top tablet brand when it comes to customer satisfaction. The latest survey from <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/13/apple-tops-j-d-powers-tablet-survey-barely-beating-amazon-tablets-top-smartphones-for-usage/">J.D. Power</a> put it just ahead of the Kindle Fire &#8212; with the $199 price tag of Amazon&#8217;s basic tablet carrying a lot of currency among users at the moment.</p>
<p>The best hope for top tablet contenders, it seems, is for there to be a delayed reaction to seeing effective ads, with users taking note and remembering the impact during the holiday shopping season &#8212; the biggest buying period for consumer electronics in the U.S.</p>
<p>Sentiments like this one &#8212; &#8220;This ad got my attention particularly because I’ll be in the market for a new tablet around Christmastime. In a few seconds, they showed several important/ useful applications. I will be looking further at the Samsung Galaxy.&#8221; &#8212; could give a boost to Samsung in sales. Unless Apple gets its way and a sales ban gets put into effect. (That case is coming up on December 6 &#8212; and Apple has demonstrated in the past that holiday-season injunctions can be a <a target="_blank" href="http://paidcontent.org/2011/11/25/419-white-friday-for-samsung-a-lifeline-in-its-aussie-galaxy-tablet-injunct/">real pain for Samsung</a>.)</p>
<p>Another worry is that the top tablet maker is indeed launching another product soon, with perhaps an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2012/08/23/iphone-5-and-ipad-mini-events/">iPad Mini</a> waiting in the wings for a pre-holiday launch.</p>
<p>Ace Metrix notes that Apple hasn&#8217;t been buying up as much advertising airtime of late &#8212; with its last ad appearing at the beginning of August. &#8220;Do It More Beautifully&#8221; has been Apple&#8217;s most effective ad so far this year, the analysts say, but its Ace Score of 627 still wasn&#8217;t high enough to make the top-10.</p>
<p>That ad also gave Apple its biggest &#8220;change score&#8221; of 670, but that, too, was some way behind the lowest change score in the top-10.</p>
<p>This points to a potential turning of the tides for Apple, says Ace Metrix. &#8220;The key to the success of these ads is the demonstration of new, exciting features that consumers have never seen before. For example, Samsung demonstrates multi-tasking, use of a stylus, etc.—all contributors to big &#8216;Change&#8217; scores, a critical Ace Metrix indicator that consumers’ opinions are changing about a brand,&#8221; writes Peter Daboll, CEO.</p>
<p>But dont&#8217; go thinking that being absent in ads has a clear inverse variation with a product&#8217;s success. The Nook tablet from Barnes &amp; Noble, is also absent from the top ad rankings, with its most successful ad, from May, achieving an Ace Score of only 582. The Nook currently only has a 9% market share among U.S. tablet owners, according to the ONA.</p>
