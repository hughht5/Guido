<p>Apple just announced a retina version of the 13-inch MacBook Pro. &#8220;It&#8217;s incredibly thin,&#8221; said Phil Schiler. The new model is .79-inch thin and weighs 3.57 &#8212; 1 lbs lighter than the previous version. &#8220;And best of all,&#8221; said Phil, &#8220;it has a retina display.&#8221;</p>
