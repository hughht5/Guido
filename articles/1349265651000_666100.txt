These stores will open on October 26, and will appear in 32 locations across both countries.</p>
<p>The retail push from Microsoft will help the tech company push its Windows 8 operating system, which it recently revealed will <a title="Microsoft Will Release Windows 8 On October 26" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/18/microsoft-will-release-windows-8-on-october-26/">also debut on October 26</a>. Having stores, with retail staff and computers running the new OS, will help the software giant educate consumers about the product. Now, more than ever, that might be necessary – Windows 8 represents a significant shift from previous incarnations of the desktop operating system, one that finally shifts focus away from the actual desktop itself as the primary place of interaction. Instead, a new tile-based interface based on Windows Phone 7&#8242;s mobile OS takes over, and that&#8217;s something <a target="_blank" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/microsofts-got-a-big-problem-with-windows-8-its-not-easy-for-windows-users-to-figure-out-2012-5">some users have had trouble adjusting to</a>.</p>
<p>These pop-up stores will help Microsoft expand its in-person reach, more than doubling its existing and planned permanent physical retail reach. Of course, outside of North America, this move obviously won&#8217;t have much of an impact. In any case, it&#8217;ll be interesting to see how users respond to Windows 8 when it gets wide release, and whether expanded retail presence hurries adoption, or helps users get over potential growing pains with Win 8&#8242;s radical redesign.</p>
