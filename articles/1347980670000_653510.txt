<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/tmp_5056874c65f8a.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="tmp_5056874c65f8a" title="tmp_5056874c65f8a" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Before the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/17/apple-announces-record-pre-orders-for-iphone-5-2m-in-24-hours/">hot-selling iPhone 5</a> launched into existence, most of the surprise had already been ruined. We saw parts, heard about launch dates, and even saw full-fledged photos of the device. So if that disappointed you as much as it did me, you might want to look away.</p>
<p>These <a target="_blank" href="http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=zh-CN&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bolopad.com%2Fhtml%2Fshow-22-1510-1.html">leaked pictures</a> certainly appear to be of a legitimate iPad mini. The design matches up well with what we&#8217;ve heard (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nowhereelse.fr/ipad-mini-maquette-photos-70841/">and seen</a>) so far &mdash; thinner bezels along the side, aluminum back plate, and some strange hole in the top center of the tablet&#8217;s backside. </p>
<p>You&#8217;ll notice an unfamiliar weather icon on the homescreen, which also appears on the images in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nowhereelse.fr/ipad-mini-maquette-photos-70841/">this article</a>, out of France. It&#8217;s a <a target="_blank" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tian-qi-yu-bao/id392901672?mt=8">Chinese Weather app</a>, which leads us to believe that this may indeed be a legitimate leak out of a Chinese factory. </p>
<p>A quick search for iPad mini cases on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.alibaba.com/showroom/ipad-mini-case.html">Alibaba</a> brings up dozens of cases matching this design, including the mysterious hole in the back. </p>
<p>Oddly, there is no Clock app as we&#8217;ve seen on <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/11/apple-announces-ios-6-wwdc/">iOS 6</a>. Google Maps and YouTube apps also seem to be on the homescreen of the tablet. Perhaps the owners got the device to run iOS 5, and have installed some third-party or prototype Weather app. Or, more likely, the screen isn&#8217;t live yet, and that&#8217;s just a mockup display. </p>
<p>You&#8217;ll also notice what appears to be a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/apples-new-lightning-connector-what-it-does-and-doesnt-change/">Lightning dock</a> on the bottom, alongside dual speakers. </p>
<p>If real, the iPad mini must be right around the corner. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/24/rumor-mill-apple-is-two-holding-separate-events-for-the-new-iphone-and-ipad/">We&#8217;ve posited</a>, along with known Apple psychics like John Gruber and Jim Dalrymple, that Apple wouldn&#8217;t crowd the iPhone 5 and iPad mini into the same launch event. They deserve their own moments in the sun. </p>
<p>Considering that the company announced a bevy of music products at the iPhone 5 event (<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/apple-announces-the-new-ipod-nano-2-5-display-home-button-38-thinner-7-colors/">new iPods</a> and a revamped iTunes), the usual October music event will be quite boring without a new product. </p>
