<p>As you may well know, we&#8217;re going to visit <a href="http://techcrunch.com/tag/northern-meetups/">Toronto, Detroit, and Chicago in November</a> and we&#8217;d like to invite you all out for a beer. We&#8217;re at the point in the game that we&#8217;ve found a venue, gotten nearly 3,000 RSVPs, and are girding our livers and minds for your pitches. So here&#8217;s what&#8217;s up:</p>
<p>We need sponsors for these events. We need someone to pay for booze, some light appetizers, and stun guns for Matt when he tries to do his <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zniDzLLhcjg">Frank the Tank impression</a>. In exchange for sponsorship we offer logos and descriptions on our meet-up posts and our undying gratitude and love. Interested or need more than that? Talk to <a target="_blank" href="mailto:sponsors@techcrunch.com">Leslie</a>, our amazing sponsorship coordinator. We have always depended on the kindness of strangers so we need you guys to help us out.</p>
<p>The goal of these meetups is to meet amazing people from places we rarely write about. For you this is a hiring event, a networking event, and a chance to get the word out about your town. In short, let&#8217;s do this thing.</p>
