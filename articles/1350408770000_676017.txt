<p>Senior VP of Products and User Experience of LinkedIn, Deep Nishar, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/16/live-from-the-meet-the-new-linkedin-event-watch-the-transformation-of-the-worlds-1-professional-social-network/">discussed the company approach</a> to design and iteration, which is extremely interesting. He says that since January 2009, its members has gone from 32M members to 175M+ members. That&#8217;s quite a lift for a niche network, especially one that isn&#8217;t all fun and games like Facebook.</p>
<p>Over time, the company made things like the &#8220;share&#8221; button more accessible, and it saw instant increases in engagement. Nishar says that users &#8220;Love it.&#8221; The company pays very close attention to its users, as there&#8217;s a good chunk of them that pay for features on the service. When a user pays, the game changes. </p>
