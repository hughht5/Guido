Microsoft posted revenues of $16.01  billion and earnings per share of $0.53. That&#8217;s down from the company&#8217;s <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/19/microsoft-posts-192m-q4-2012-loss-because-of-6-19b-aquantive-writedown-18-06b-revenue/">Q4 2012 results</a> of $18.06 billion but up from last quarter&#8217;s loss per share of $0.06.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Microsoft&#8217;s results in the last quarter were also highly influenced by the company&#8217;s ill-fated aQuantive acquisition. To account for this, Microsoft took a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-02/microsoft-will-write-down-6-2-billion-related-to-aquantive-deal.html">$6.19 billion writedown</a> last quarter.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ahead of the earnings release, the <a target="_blank" href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ae?s=MSFT+Analyst+Estimates">analyst consensus</a> was the Microsoft would report revenues of about $16.42 billion and earnings per share around $0.56. Sales growth, most analysts expected, would be negative (around -5.50%), as many consumers and businesses held off from major investments ahead of the upcoming Windows 8 launch.</p>
<p>“The launch of Windows 8 is the beginning of a new era at Microsoft,” said Steve Ballmer, chief executive officer at Microsoft, in a canned statement today. “Investments we’ve made over a number of years are now coming together to create a future of exceptional devices and services, with tremendous opportunity for our customers, developers, and partners.”</p>
<p>Some additional highlights from the release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The<strong> Online Services Division</strong> reported revenue of $697 million, a 9% increase from the prior year period. Online advertising revenue grew 15% driven primarily by an increase in revenue per search.</li>
<li>The <strong>Windows &amp; Windows Live Division</strong> posted revenue of $3.24 billion, a 33% decrease from the prior year period. Adjusting for the impact of the Windows Upgrade Offer and pre-sales of Windows 8 to OEMs prior to general availability, Windows division non-GAAP revenue declined 9% for the first quarter. Windows 8 will become generally available October 26, 2012.</li>
<li>The <strong>Microsoft Business Division posted</strong> $5.50 billion in first-quarter revenue, a 2% decrease from the prior year period.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So far this year, Microsoft&#8217;s stock is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/finance?client=ob&amp;q=NASDAQ:MSFT">up about 13%</a>. but the next quarter will obviously be far more interesting for Microsoft, as the company was clearly in between release cycles in the last quarter. With Windows 8 and Windows 8 Phone, as well as its Surface tablets and other upcoming releases, the Microsoft is putting a lot of bets on the table at the same time and it remains to be seen if these gambles will pay off.</p>
