<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/square_logo.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="Square" title="Square" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.squareup.com">Square</a> has taken its first step outside of the U.S. for its mobile payment service: it is now live in Canada. The company said today that its mobile card reader/processor is now available nationwide, priced at the same rate as in its home market: 2.75% per swipe. In the U.S. there are now 2 million businesses using Square&#8217;s system, making a total of $8 billion in annualized payments.</p>
<p>This is a sign that the company has come good on its promise that it would start to make its first international moves by the end of this year &#8212; a commitment that it made when it announced its <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/17/square-closes-200m-series-d-from-starbucks-citi-rizvi-at-3-25b-valuation/">latest round of funding</a>, a Series D of $200 million, in September. That investment reportedly valued the company at $3.25 billion.</p>
<p>Canada is an easy and obvious move for the company. The physical proximity of the country makes it potentially easier on an operational level, and there no language barrier. It is also a market where the magnetic stripe at the back of the card is still the most common and accepted way of processing transactions. That makes it all fairly easy for Square to sell into this market:</p>
<p>&#8220;We are focused on making commerce easy for everyone. Square builds free tools for local businesses of all sizes and types to thrive,&#8221; said Alyssa Cutright, VP of International for Square, in a statement. &#8220;We’re thrilled to introduce Canadian businesses and their customers to the most seamless and enjoyable way to do business.&#8221;</p>
<p>This will be something that Square needs to address when it comes to other markets like Europe, where the chip-and-pin system, and not the mag-stripe, are the most common way of processing card transactions. (This is where European companies like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.izettle.com">iZettle</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.payleven.de">Payleven</a> and others could have an advantage and potentially serve as strategic partners for Square when and if it chooses to come to Europe.)</p>
<p>But the dongle that is the &#8220;square&#8221; of Square is only one part of the equation. Square&#8217;s partnership with Starbucks could be a window on to another route for how Square will go into other markets. Starubucks is integrating the company&#8217;s Pay With Square app service into its own app, meaning that users will be able to charge their Frappuccinos and muffins via Square without the dongle ever coming into the equation. Starbucks&#8217; CEO Howard Schultz has not ruled out taking Square to the many markets where it offers services. What he has said is that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/08/square-starbucks-qa/">it will be up to Square CEO Jack Dorsey</a> to decide when to make that move.</p>
<p>We have been hearing a lot of murmurs about where Square may go next, with some believing Asia will be next on the cards.</p>
<p>Part of today&#8217;s deal also includes access to Square&#8217;s Square Register app. That is the point-of-sale system that Square offers not just to process payments but to track inventory, monitor overall transaction reports, and loyalty programs. Merchants can also promote their business through the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.square.ca/directory">Square directory</a>. The point of sale system is where Square most closely starts to come into competition against the likes of Groupon, which is also driving a similar payment/point-of-sale product launch in the form of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/10/groupon-gets-down-to-commerce-releases-newly-acquired-point-of-sale-app-breadcrumb-bundled-with-a-free-ipad/">Breadcrumb</a>.</p>
