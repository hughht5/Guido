You can&#8217;t call it apology &#8212; quite the opposite: Apple makes it clear it does not agree with the court&#8217;s decision by pointing out that it has had court wins against Samsung for the same design patent in Germany, and noting its huge win against the Korean gadget maker in the U.S this summer.</p>
