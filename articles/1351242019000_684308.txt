You can&#8217;t call it an apology &#8212; quite the opposite: Apple makes it clear it does not agree with the court&#8217;s decision by pointing out that it has had court wins against Samsung for the same design patent in Germany, and noting its <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/24/apple-wins-patent-ruling-as-jury-finds-samsung-infringes/">huge win</a> against the Korean gadget maker in the U.S this summer.</p>
<p>Apple also focuses on the judge&#8217;s reasons for dismissing its patent claim &#8212; quoting the judge&#8217;s detailed ruling on exactly what makes the iPad&#8217;s design so much cooler than the Galaxy Tab, in which he talks almost lovingly of the &#8220;extreme simplicity&#8221; of the iPad&#8217;s design; its &#8220;undecorated surfaces&#8221;; &#8220;crisp edge&#8221; and &#8220;combination of curves&#8221;.</p>
<p>Apple then contrasts that with what the judge had to say about the Galaxy Tab: &#8220;very thin, almost insubstantial&#8221; with &#8220;unusual details on the back&#8221; &#8212; and the conclusion: &#8220;not cool&#8221;.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Apple&#8217;s acknowledgment in full</p>

<p>The acknowledgement has not been published on the homepage of Apple&#8217;s U.K. website but there is a link to it &#8212; right at the bottom of the page, next to the notification about Apple&#8217;s use of cookies</p>
