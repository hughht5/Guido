LinkedIn co-founder and Greylock partner <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/reid-hoffman">Reid Hoffman</a> has become known for giving solid advice &#8212; both to the entrepreneurs in which he invests, as well as the general public with his recent book <em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Start-up-You-Transform-ebook/dp/B0050DIWHU">The Startup Of You</a></em>. So when he came backstage at Disrupt SF earlier this week after his <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/10/reid-hoffman-next-wave-of-tech-ipos-will-be-enterprise-with-consumer-flare-arrington-yawns/">fireside chat with Michael Arrington</a>, we just had to ask him: What is some bad advice that people often give to entrepreneurs that they should ignore?</p>
<p>According to Hoffman, one big mistake is listening to others talk too much about making money. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;People frequently try to talk about business models too early. The question comes down to, when you&#8217;re a seed stage company people say, &#8216;Well what&#8217;s your business model?&#8217; And the answer is, a seed stage consumer company, you hopefully have some puzzle pieces and you&#8217;re thinking about what the business model might be, but if you say it with confidence, you&#8217;re wrong. because most often those change.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>We also asked about why he thinks LinkedIn has had a more <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/19/linkedin-ipo-shares-pop-84-percent-on-first-trade/">well-received initial public offering</a> than, say, Facebook. His answer was that it mostly comes down to expectations:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think we benefited from the fact that we never had a period in our lives when we were described as the &#8216;total world killer.&#8217; So, no one every had this expectation of us that it was like, the whole world&#8217;s gonna change when we IPO [or] a year after we IPO. And so it&#8217;s been easier for us to beat people&#8217;s expectations for us.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s really just a pleasure to talk to Hoffman, so watch the entire video above to hear him also discuss which young entrepreneur he&#8217;s most excited about (hint, he hails from Sweden), what is on his ten-year-plan, and more.</p>
