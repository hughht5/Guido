Previous investors, Nauta Capital, and Oxford Partners also participated in what is for them effectively a follow-on round.</p>
<p>The new funds will be used to &#8220;fuel growth&#8221; and support its recent U.S. launch, and maintain what the company claims is a market leadership position. (Well, they would say that, wouldn&#8217;t they.)</p>
<p>Essentially, iJento&#8217;s offering gives a shot in the arm to existing analytics services (Google Analytics, Adobe SiteCatalyst, and Webtrends Analytics etc.), as well as plugging into other customer data, to extract better intelligence, thus enabling businesses to understand customers on an individual level through the ability to do things like observe individual customer journeys, &#8220;identify high value consumer segments&#8221; and target customers with relevant and timely information and offers in a scalable way &#8212; which seems to be the technology play here.</p>
<p>The result, and carrot as it were, is that this added customer intelligence is seeing iJento&#8217;s customers increase their bottom line, claims the company, citing LV= Insurance which has seen a 26% increase in sales conversions thanks to iJento&#8217;s offering.</p>
<p>Other major brands and businesses that iJento claims as clients include: Allianz, Cheapflights Media, FT.com and Tesco Bank.</p>
<p>To that end, iJento doesn&#8217;t just sell its ware directly to businesses but is said to be partnering with &#8220;leading analytics and digital marketing related technology companies and consulting firms&#8221;, according to press release.</p>
<p>iJento has offices in the UK, USA and Australia.</p>
