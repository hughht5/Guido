The founders meanwhile are now looking to sell the site, as Facebook won&#8217;t be needing it.</p>
<p>Facebook tells me there wasn&#8217;t something specific that attracted it to the co-founders other than that &#8220;they&#8217;re awesomeÂ entrepreneurs&#8221;. They haven&#8217;t been set up with a specific team at Facebook, but I think they could potentially fit well on the new Facebook Gifts team, helping people find the right, and right priced, gift for friends.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have more details soon.</p>
