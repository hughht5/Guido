The founders meanwhile are now looking to sell the site, as Facebook won&#8217;t be needing it.</p>
<p>Facebook won&#8217;t say what team the founders will be joining. However, they might be a good fit to help the new Facebook Gifts team find people the perfect present at the perfect price. Otherwise, the Events team might work, considering Dwight&#8217;s been throwing a few of them as a cast member on the soon-to-air Bravo reality show Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>TechCrunch named Carsabi one of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/27/best-of-y-combinator-demo-day/">YC Demo Day Winter 2012 &#8216;s 10 Best Companies</a>. The startup crawls all available online car sale listings including dealers and classifieds to find you awesome deals. It challenges AutoTrader, and innovated with its feature to sort by biggest savings opposed to just the lowest price. Carsabi also integrates social so you can ask friends for purchase advice, oh, and spread the service virally.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the full text of the &#8220;We&#8217;re Joining Facebook!&#8221; blog post Carsabi just published:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;We created Carsabi back in Oct 2011 with the goal of easing the process of purchasing a used car, and providing a service that aims to index every automotive vehicle and connect more users to their car of choice each day.</em></p>
<p><em>But now it’s time for us to take a different turn. We want to take this impact to the next level – and help Facebook users connect and share. Because Facebook is not acquiring Carsabi.com, we&#8217;re looking for someone to buy the Carsabi service, so the two of us can focus on our new jobs. We can’t thank all of you that have used Carsabi enough – developing Carsabi has been an incredibly rewarding experience, and we hope we helped you think differently about how to find the perfect used car!</em></p>
<p><em>We want to give special thanks to our partners, customers and investors for helping us fulfill our dream.</em></p>
<p><em>Christopher &amp; Dwight&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
