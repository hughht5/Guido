This update, which follows a similar update to virtually all of the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/04/microsoft-announces-updates-for-virtually-all-of-its-built-in-windows-8-apps/">built-in Windows 8 Metro apps</a> earlier this week, will bring improvements &#8220;in broad areas of performance, power management and battery efficiency, media playback, and compatibility.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Microsoft&#8217;s Steven Sinofsky notes in today&#8217;s announcement, Microsoft often shipped similar updates to its OEMs ahead of the launch of a new version of Windows. &#8220;We would often create dozens of changes for each OEM for these new PCs. Those changes would be deployed during manufacturing of those PCs and thus would be invisible to customers,&#8221; he writes. Most users, however, would only see these updates after Microsoft released the first service pack for any given version of Windows. &#8216;</p>
<p>This time around, however, Microsoft has decided to build the necessary tools to deliver these &#8220;post-RTM&#8221; updates to all users long before the release of the first service pack. If you are a MSDN or enterprise customer with Windows 8 already installed on your PC, the so-called &#8220;General Availability Cumulative Update&#8221; should now be available via Windows Update. Microsoft says these updates will follow the standard Windows Update rhythm (a.k.a. <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_Tuesday">Patch Tuesday</a>), which pushes out new code every second Tuesday of each month.</p>
<p>Here is the <a target="_blank" href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2756872">full changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Improvements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Increased power efficiency to extend battery life</li>
<li>Performance improvements in Windows 8 applications and Start screen</li>
<li>Improved audio and video playback in many scenarios</li>
<li>Improved application and driver compatibility with Windows 8</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Known issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When you turn a Windows feature on or off, the computer may require a restart. For example, this action may be necessary when you turn Remote Access on or off.</li>
</ul>
