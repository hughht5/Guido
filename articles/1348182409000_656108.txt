Caviar is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.seamless.com/">Seamless</a> &#8220;done right&#8221; i.e. a platform that allows users to order food &#8220;seamlessly&#8221; via web. As of today, users in SF can sign up for access to the Caviar beta, which differentiates itself from Seamless by only offering orders from restaurants that don&#8217;t typically deliver.</p>
<p>With its focus on curation, Caviar limits its inventory to restaurants that have four stars or higher on Yelp. &#8220;[With] Seamless, you don&#8217;t really need to use them to get the food. You can call the restaurant yourself and they&#8217;ll take the order over the phone and deliver it to you,&#8221; says founder Jason Wang, on why Caviar is a net value add in an already crowded space.</p>
<p>In addition to cherry-picking vendors, Caviar also offers picture menus, real-time delivery tracking and no minimum order limits in order to be competitive with startups like Seamless or GrubHub. It also offers scheduling options in addition to &#8220;Deliver Now,&#8221; with a $9.99 flat rate anywhere in SF and Treasure Island.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our sweet spot with Caviar is businesses. When we ask them what their current solution is, they tell us GrubHub, Seamless, or a catering company such as Cater2me, or <a target="_blank" href="http://waiter.com/Waiter">Waiter.com/Waiter</a> On Wheels,&#8221; says Wang. &#8220;We&#8217;re better than GrubHub and Seamless (and there are others like Eat24hours and <a target="_blank" href="http://delivery.com/">Delivery.com</a>) in every way. They have a laundry list of every possible restaurant and nearly all of them you don&#8217;t really like that much.&#8221;</p>
<p>In San Francisco, the service is presently offering deliveries from local foodie favorites like Pork Store Cafe and Little Star Pizza, which you&#8217;d otherwise have to use something like Postmates to get food from.</p>
<p>Wang tells me the bootstrapped service, which takes a 25% cut from its restaurant partners, is already profitable. In user testing since early July, the average Caviar user has spent $154.07 in the past month.</p>
<p>Today, the first 150 TechCrunch readers who want in on Caviar will receive their invites immediately, and then it&#8217;s first come first serve with new invites rolling out daily. The team is hoping to hit up obvious target NYC after it conquers SF&#8217;s rarified hunger pangs.</p>
