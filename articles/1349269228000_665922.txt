This brings Betterment&#8217;s total funding to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/01/bessemer-betterment-3-million/">$13 million.</a></p>
<p>Betterment, which <a target="_blank" href="https://www.betterment.com/blog/2010/05/25/betterment-launches-on-stage-at-techcrunch-disrupt/">launched at TechCrunch Disrupt</a> in 2010, aims to disrupt the financial savings industry by letting customers invest their savings in a carefully-selected blend of stock and bond portfolios which are rebalanced regularly and automatically. The company combines the accessibility of an online savings account with the performance of an investing account.</p>
<p>The New York City startup is a registered broker dealer and financial adviser. The only fee it charges is a tiered management fee that is a percentage of assets in each account. The startup&#8217;s clients range from sophisticated investors looking for a set-and-forget investment alternative, to traditional savers looking for a conservative bridge into stock and bond investing.</p>
<p>More recently, Betterment has evolved to include traditional and Roth IRAs, and additional features like auto-deposit, goal-based investing, and more. The company recently debuted Betterment Gifts, an online gift registry that allows people to contribute to a life event.</p>
<p>The company says that it has been increasing customer assets under management at 500% per year.</p>
<p>The funding will be used to develop an improved mobile experience, add better options for shorter term goals, and create new behavior-based ways to encourage people to make the most of their money and lives.</p>
