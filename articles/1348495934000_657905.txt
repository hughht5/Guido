<p>Remember that one time you downloaded iOS 6? You were so excited about features like Panorama and&#8230; well, Maps. There was nothing else to be all that excited about, at least from a Christmas-morning, I-can&#8217;t-wait-to-play point of view. And then, you opened up Apple Maps to find that your childhood home didn&#8217;t really look like your childhood home at all, but a flat, f&amp;#(ked up version of your childhood home, and that you were actually two blocks east of where you thought you were, despite the street signs that told you otherwise?</p>
<p>Those were good times.</p>
<p>Do you remember the moment you realized that you don&#8217;t have access to Google Maps anymore, when you silently lifted your eyes to the heavens and thought, &#8220;What have I done?&#8221; Hacker Ryan Petrich felt the same way, and he&#8217;s here to help rescue us, &#8220;coaxing&#8221; iOS 5 Google Maps onto a jailbroken iPhone running iOS 6.</p>
<p>According to <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/rpetrich/status/249802824567881728">a tweet</a>, and the YouTube video (above), Petrich has the old version of Google Maps working, yet says it&#8217;s still &#8220;crashy&#8221; and he isn&#8217;t ready to share the method quite yet. To get iOS 5 Google Maps running on an iOS 6 device, it must first be jailbroken. Luckily, the iPhone 5 has already <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/22/iphone-5-jailbroken-according-to-ios-hacker-chpwn/">been spotted running Cydia</a>.</p>
<p>No word on when Petrich might be ready to share his secret recipe, but there is hope, my friends. And with the way Apple Maps have been performing, the homebrew/unlocker crowd may get quite a bit bigger in the near future. That is, if Apple fails in <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/23/source-apple-aggressively-recruiting-ex-google-maps-staff-to-build-out-ios-maps/">poaching Google Maps staffers</a>.</p>
