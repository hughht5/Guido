I&#8217;ve been using it for a few months thanks to the developer version, and my experience has been maddening. Why? Because I take public transportation. A lot.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re someone, like me, who lives in a metropolitan area like San Francisco or New York, then you know that schedules for public transit are your lifeblood. The experience needs to be fast and accurate, otherwise you&#8217;re stuck sitting around, and that blows.</p>
<p>Apple has decided to leave public transportation to third party apps, which is a really bad user experience in my opinion.  If you take public transportation and will be using iOS 6, here&#8217;s what you can expect now that Google Maps has been yanked:</p>
<p>First, put in your address as usual, then select public transportation as your option:</p>

<p>Um, ok.</p>
<p>Then, you&#8217;re tossed to a list of third-party transit apps, which is empty if you don&#8217;t have any. Luckily, I did. I select it, and then&#8230;.</p>

<p>Yeah, forget that shit. Take something that&#8217;s fast and convenient and turn it into a mess by adding the extra steps of downloading new apps from people I don&#8217;t know, and then having to tap them and open them separately. Good Job, Good Effort, Apple.</p>
<p><b>UPDATE:</b> To be fair to Transit App, a third-party option that I have, they&#8217;re having hosting issues. However, this illustrates my point perfectly.</p>
