It&#8217;s an interesting question, and one that I&#8217;ve thought a lot about as I&#8217;ve watched Twitter change the way it works with developers. I figured that the answer would be a flat-out &#8220;No&#8221;, but it sounds like this is something that Facebook has thought about.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg said that the company would rather go about things by introducing advertising options for developers, so that everyone can make a few dollars. With the surge of growth for the social network coming from mobile devices, the company has to think about how to monetize every pixel that is displayed to users.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that Zuckerberg is not interested in making developers pay the bills, and I think that&#8217;s a smart way to go about things.</p>
<p>This is developing.</p>
