The app does so using a technology called JPEGmini, which has previously only been available for Mac desktops and server applications.</p>
<p>Many iPhone users are unaware that when they use photo-sharing tools and applications, the quality of their photos is reduced. For example, when uploading a photo from the iPhone to Facebook, the quality is reduced by 90%, going from 8 MP to 0.7 MP. With Beamr, however, those photos can be shared with family and friends via email, Facebook, or Twitter, without image quality reduction.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s making this possible is JPEGmini, a photo compression technology that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/06/new-startup-jpegmini-reduces-photos-size-not-their-quality/">first debuted last September</a>, promising image reductions of up to five times. &#8220;We invested three years of research using our top image scientists in finding a mathematical formula that really simulates the human vision and gives results that are very highly correlated with subjective results about the image quality,&#8221; explains Dror Gill, co-founder and CTO at JPEGMini, makers of Beamr. (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.jpegmini.com/main/technology">This page</a> on the JPEGmini website has more technical details).</p>
<p>Gill, a pioneer in online streaming and VoIP while at IBM, says the company now has 28 patent applications surrounding this  they&#8217;ve created, with filings here in the U.S., Europe and Japan, and they&#8217;re now working to bring their video compression technology to the new Beamr app as well. &#8220;Our grand vision is reducing the file size and bitrate without reducing the image quality,&#8221; Gill says.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/29/beamr-for-iphone-lets-you-share-photos-in-full-resolution/beamr2/" rel="attachment wp-att-685859"></a>The company also has two other products on the market. On is the consumer-facing <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jpegmini.com/mac">JPEGmini app</a>, mentioned above, which lets users save disk space on their Mac by optimizing photos locally. The other is the enterprise-facing <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jpegmini.com/server">JPEGmini for Server</a>, used by large websites to optimize their page load times. Due to NDAs, Gill can&#8217;t talk about the company&#8217;s enterprise customers, but says they include some of the &#8220;top web portals and e-commerce websites&#8221; in the U.S., Japan and India.</p>
<p>Now, with <a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/beamr/id560470786?mt=8">Beamr</a>, the company is porting that same JPEGmini technology to mobile in order to solve the problem of transferring media files over the cellular network.</p>
<p>The app itself is very simple to use. When you first launch Beamr, you&#8217;re presented with your Camera Roll, and you just select the photos you want to share. In the next step, you pick one photo as your &#8220;magazine cover&#8221; and then choose how you want to share the photos (email, Facebook or Twitter.) While there are plenty of other applications for photo-sharing, Gill explains that Beamr is unique because it&#8217;s allowing you to share the full resolution photos (8 MP or 28 MP for panoramas).</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re sharing the photos, however, you&#8217;re actually sharing a link to a website where recipients can view the photos in an attractive magazine-style layout. Because the app requires no registration in order to be quick and easy to use, the link is not password-protected, but is rather tucked behind an obfuscated URL. From the shared website, recipients can view or download the photos if they choose.</p>
<p>In the future, Beamr will add a similar compression technology for sharing video, and will introduce an Android version as well. <a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/beamr/id560470786?mt=8">Beamr is free in the iTunes App Store here</a>.</p>
<p>Based in Tel Aviv, now has an undisclosed amount of angel funding and is beginning to raise a VC round.</p>
