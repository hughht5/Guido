<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/momentme1.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="momentme1" title="momentme1" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p><a target="_blank" href="http://moment.me/">Moment.me</a> is a new iPhone application that automatically aggregates photos, videos, and tweets from social networks, and then organizes them into multimedia albums it calls &#8220;moments.&#8221; It currently supports Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Google+, meaning it sources the content from those networks to create these moments, so you don&#8217;t have to change any of your current sharing behavior.</p>
<p>The system works using a proprietary &#8220;smart-matching&#8221; technology to determine which pieces of content should be organized together. When an event is ongoing, a red &#8220;Live&#8221; banner appears, indicating that updates are still coming in.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/?attachment_id=655225" rel="attachment wp-att-655225"></a>&#8220;We saw an unfilled void in the social web,&#8221; says CEO Ronny Elkayam. &#8220;Photo and video sharing sites were popping up all over, showcasing people&#8217;s experiences, while at the same time, people were tweeting to their followers while at live public events – from concerts and parties to political rallies. However,&#8221; he adds, &#8220;there was nothing around that collected all the pics, videos, and tweets from an experience and presented them in a format where people could see 360-degree views of the entire experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>With Moment.me, the end result is something which is very much like <a target="_blank" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flock-photos-together/id543421080?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Flock</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/26/bump-flock/">the new shared photo albums app from Bump</a>, which lets you automatically share photos you snap at the same location with any of your Facebook friends. And by &#8220;share,&#8221; I mean <span style="text-decoration:underline;">without</span> having to first post them to Facebook, upload them in the app, or really do anything other than install and configure Flock on your iPhone. (It&#8217;s brilliant, actually, and I&#8217;ve been evangelizing it to my family and friends.)</p>
<p>Moment.me has a similar idea, but the difference is that it doesn&#8217;t require others to <em>actually use the app</em> to provide value. &#8220;Even if a user is the only one in the room with the Moment.me app, if they&#8217;re hanging out with people they&#8217;re connected with in their social networks, they&#8217;ll still see great Moments with their friends&#8217; content included,&#8221; explains Elkayam. &#8220;We call this the &#8216;empty room scenario.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/?attachment_id=655224" rel="attachment wp-att-655224"></a>That&#8217;s an interesting concept, and it could be a big differentiator for Moment.me, but in practice, I found myself questioning some of the results. For example, Moment.me discovered my tweets and photos from Thursday at TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2012, but only matched me with one other person, a Facebook friend who was also there. Surely <em>someone</em> <em>else</em> on my Twitter, Facebook, Instagram (etc.) networks was also sharing content? Right??</p>
<p>It sounds like Moment.me&#8217;s proprietary matching tech still needs a tweak. Or maybe apps like this just work better when people actually install them on their devices! (So um, <a target="_blank" href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/moment.me/id551340583">please do that</a>.)</p>
<p>In terms of user privacy, Moment.me complies with everyone&#8217;s social network privacy settings. That means if you&#8217;re posting to a select group of friends on Facebook via lists, that photo doesn&#8217;t (creepily) become available in the app to a Facebook friend in a different group.</p>
<p>The 10-person company was founded in February 2012 in Tel Aviv by Elkayam, Eilon Tirosh, and Boaz Adato. In May, it took in $1.5 million in seed funding from Blumberg Capital and other private investors. Today, the R&amp;D continues in Israel, but there&#8217;s a small office in New York.</p>
