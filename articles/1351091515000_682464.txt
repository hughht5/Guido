This brings a whole bunch of new features to the table, including single sign-on with both Facebook and Microsoft credentials, so that new users don&#8217;t even have to sign up for Skype itself, Retina display compatibility for Macs, and multi-window chats, so that you can have conversations going in multiple windows at the same time.</p>
<p>On the Mac side, Skype has been slowly building back up from a significant redesign that struck a lot of users the wrong way, adding a lot of clutter and unnecessary screen real estate occupancy to what was once a very simple app. It&#8217;s been getting a lot better, and this update really steps up the game for owners of Apple&#8217;s 15-inch Retina MacBook Pro, or those hoping to buy the<a title="First Impressions Of The 13″ Retina MacBook Pro: On The Path To A New Category-Defining Product" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/23/first-impressions-of-the-13-retina-macbook-pro-on-the-path-to-a-new-category-defining-product/"> new 13-inch version</a>.</p>
<p>Also new to the Skype desktop app is the ability to chat with Live Messenger, Hotmail and Outlook contacts via Skype  just like you&#8217;ve been able to do with Facebook contacts for a while now. Eventually, Microsoft will roll out voice and video calls for Microsoft network contacts as well, something it says will arrive &#8220;in coming weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Generally, I&#8217;m wary when a big company buys a smaller one with a cool product, but so far, Microsoft has actually been very kind to Skype&#8217;s product, and made a number of considerable improvements. Let&#8217;s hope Redmond keeps at it.</p>
