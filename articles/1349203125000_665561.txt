Pics of the 7.85-inch tablet hit the interwebs today and show a tablet similar to the iPhone 5. The tablet is said to sport a nano-SIM card slot for wireless network support. The casing is also reportedly anodized aluminum, a material iPhone 5 owners <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/24/657820/">quickly discovered</a> scratches very easily.</p>
<p>These pics match the form factor foreshadowed by the 3rd party cases currently available from Chinese manufacturers. The pics show a tablet that looks more like a big iPhone rather than a smaller iPad. The side bezel is smaller and the speakers are placed on the bottom, flanking a Lightning port.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/12/10/02/purported-ipad-mini-parts-show-front-back-panels-lcd-nano-sim-tray">These pics</a> show a slightly different design than previous leaks. Other pics show a tablet built from the design cues used in the iPad: back speaker, tapered backplate, and bare aluminum casing. This one is more iPhone 5 than iPad.</p>
<p>No word on pricing or availability just yet. Invites for the October 17 event are said to hit Apple&#8217;s BFF&#8217;s inboxes on October 10. Once announced, expect the iPad mini to be relatively inexpensive (rumors state $249-$299) and be available near immediately. Move over, Furby. Small tablets are going to be the hot item this holiday season.</p>
