The slates go on sale in the U.K. today and Amazon is offering Fire buyers a one month free trial of LOVEFiLM.</p>
<p>Earlier this month <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.lovefilm.com/uncategorized/sign-in-to-lovefilm-using-amazon-account-details-for-kindle-fire-and-kindle-fire-hd-users.html">LOVEFiLM added the ability to sign in with an Amazon account</a> &#8211; a precursor to the service being &#8220;deeply integrated&#8221; into the Fire tablets. As well as streaming movies and TV shows from the thousands in LOVEFiLM&#8217;s catalogue, the Kindle Fire LOVEFiLM integration supports watch lists, for creating movie and TV playlists, and the IMDb-powered Amazon <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/06/new-kindle-fire-software-multiple-profiles-new-email-custom-facebook-and-skype-apps/">X-Ray for Movies</a> feature which lets Fire users look up information about actors &#8212; such as biog details and photos &#8212; without leaving the film.</p>
<p>The LOVEFiLM Pause and Resume function is powered by Amazon&#8217;s multi-platform viewing Whispersync technology.</p>
<p>Even closer service integration is coming &#8220;in the near future&#8221;, with Amazon noting that existing LOVEFiLM members will be able to link their Amazon and LOVEFiLM accounts together with a single sign in soon.</p>
