Apple has seen a tremendous year. With $156 billion in revenue representing 45 percent growth compared to 2011, and an incredible 61 percent increase of net income compared to 2011. But even more impressive, Apple now has $121.3 billion in cash, enough to buy Amazon or <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2199000/100-billion-space-station-saved-toothbrush.html">a space station</a>, and still having some left.</p>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s market capitalization ticks at $100.77 billion today. And many of what you could consider big tech companies have a <i>smaller</i> market cap. Yahoo&#8217;s market cap is $19.68 billion, Facebook&#8217;s is $48.33 billion. And let&#8217;s not compare to Dell or HP who have a $16.03 billion and $27.90 billion market cap.</p>
<p>As long as Apple keeps generation such profits, there is no end to this cash pile. Three months ago, Apple had $117.2 billion in the bank (short term financial investments or equivalent).</p>
<p>Apple has been very shy when it comes to acquisitions. Over the years, it has only bought a handful of companies, including Lala, Chomp and Siri.</p>
<p>Even compared to Apple&#8217;s own market capitalization, its cash represents more than 20 percent of its gigantic $571.38 billion market cap. Yet, the ratio cash versus market cap is slowly going down, because Apple shares are raising even more. Here&#8217;s the percentage evolution:</p>

<p>And of course, there are the funny comparisons. Beautiful buildings and monuments are cool, but let&#8217;s not stop there. As we&#8217;ve <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2199000/100-billion-space-station-saved-toothbrush.html">learned</a> recently, a space station &#8220;only&#8221; costs around $100 billion. Space is the next frontier, right?</p>
