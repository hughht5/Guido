While not nearly the size of Facebook or Twitter, the company has has a couple dozen apps already. Today, App.net announced a new way for <strong>users</strong><a target="_blank" href="http://jacks.tumblr.com/post/33785796042/lets-reconsider-our-users">*</a> to <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.app.net/blog/2012/10/17/app-net-directory/">discover and download apps to use on its platform</a>. The <a target="_blank" href="https://directory.app.net/">App.net Directory</a></p>
<p>App.net clearly wants to differentiate itself as friendlier social network for developers. The hope is that with great apps using its platform in new and interesting ways, <strong>users</strong> will follow to take advantage of those apps. So creating a place where <strong>users</strong> can easily find those apps — whether they&#8217;re made for desktop, web browser, or mobile devices — makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>Currently there are 27 apps available in the directory, but not every app made for the social networking platform has made its way over. App.net is also hoping to get more to sign up, nudging developers to add them to the directory through its <a target="_blank" href="https://alpha.app.net/global/">My Apps</a> link.</p>
<p>The launch of the directory comes not long after App.net announced it would <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/27/app-net-developer-incentive/">hand out at least $20,000</a> per month in rewards as part of its <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/27/app-net-developer-incentive/">App.net Developer Incentive Program</a>. With that program, App.net surveys <strong>users</strong> to see which apps they like the best, and then rewards developers based on those ratings. App.net is also trying to incentivize new people to sign up <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/01/app-net-now-has-20000-users-drops-its-price-from-50-to-36-per-year-introduces-a-5-per-month-plan/">by lowering its prices</a> after getting 20,000 users to sign up.</p>
