<blockquote class='twitter-tweet' lang='en'><p>Today. Is anniversary of Steve Jobs&#039; death.  We miss him, always will.</p>&mdash; <br />Rupert Murdoch  (@rupertmurdoch) <a href='http://twitter.com/#!/rupertmurdoch/status/262648923854880769' data-datetime='2012-10-28T20:15:57+00:00'>October 28, 2012</a></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s nice, except that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/05/apple-posts-a-video-remember-steve-jobs-and-highlighting-his-greatest-achievements/">Steve Jobs passed away on October 5th, 2011</a>. Lovely sentiment of course, but&#8230;Wow.</p>
<p>Best response so far was this:</p>
<blockquote class='twitter-tweet' lang='en'><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/rupertmurdoch">rupertmurdoch</a> time difference between California and Australia is 22 days now?</p>&mdash; <br />Tom Cook (@ywxwy) <a href='http://twitter.com/#!/ywxwy/status/262651277626966017' data-datetime='2012-10-28T20:25:19+00:00'>October 28, 2012</a></blockquote>
<p>This <a target="_blank" href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/01/15/rupert-murdoch-is-at-it-again-on-twitter-calls-google-a-piracy-leader/">isn&#8217;t the first time that this guy has embarrassed himself on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>Good Job, Good Effort Rupert. Can someone please take his Twitter account away from him?</p>
