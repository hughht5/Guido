People are <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/07/kickstarter-hit-instacube-adds-facebook-photo-streaming-in-addition-to-instagram/">crowdfunding their hardware startups</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/29/gofundme/">crowdfunding their insurance bills</a>, even <a target="_blank" href="http://wanderable.com/">crowdfunding their honeymoons</a>. And now, you can crowdfund concerts and other events. Online ticketing startup <a target="_blank" href="http://www.picatic.com/">Picatic</a> is now offering up a platform that lets promoters, artists, and venues ensure they make a profit on events by crowdfunding them.</p>
<p>EventTilt will allow promoters to create event pages with artist and venue, letting fans pay before the event is actually booked. Once a proposed concert or other event reaches a certain threshold set by the organizer &#8212; usually the breakeven point for putting the show on &#8212; then the event actually gets put together. </p>
<p>Users who help fund events through EventTilt will receive discounted tickets and maybe some type of merch, swag, or perks as a thank you gift. And those who contribute to events that don&#8217;t get fully funded get their money back. The whole thing ends up being like Kickstarter for concerts.</p>
<p>Picatic was founded in 2008, and competes in the burgeoning online ticketing world against sites like Eventbrite. While still pretty small, the introduction of EventTilt will give it a new way to get more events off the ground and to collect more revenue along the way. Since promoters will be able to de-risk the process of organizing a concert or other events, it&#8217;s possible that more will be booked through its system.</p>
<p>Of course, Picatic isn&#8217;t alone in its pursuit of concert or event crowdfunding. Brazilian startup <a target="_blank" href="http://www.queremos.com/">Queremos</a> recently <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/10/queremos/">launched at TechCrunch Disrupt</a>, and is bringing its own crowdfunding platform for events to the U.S. market. Huge Labs recently unveiled a platform for booking authors to speak about their works and crowdfunding those events called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hugeinc.com/pressroom/press-releases/huge-labs-launches-book-publishing-industry-startup-togather/">Togather</a>. And there are others, like <a target="_blank" href="http://gigfunder.com">GigFunder</a>, which do the same kind of thing.</p>
<p>Just as there are multiple crowdfunding platforms for creating hardware projects, there&#8217;s likely to be more than one of these &#8220;Kickstarter for events&#8221; companies to survive. But for the idea to really take off, one will probably have to reach critical mass and become the go-to place for cool events. Which one will it be?</p>
