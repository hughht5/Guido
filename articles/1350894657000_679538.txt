</em><br />
In what appears to be somewhat unprecedented, and perhaps signals a new era of co-operation, nine London VCs have joined forces to hold a shared office hours this Wednesday, offering a fantastic opportunity for local startups to (finally) get in front of and pitch to a VC.</p>
<p>Almost the entire London VC scene will be presented, including the likes of Index Ventures, Balderton Capital, and Eden Ventures, along with <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/13/the-new-vc-kids-on-the-block-helping-europes-startups-to-pick-up-the-pace/">newer VCs on the block</a>, such as Passion Capital, and EC1 Capital (see full list below). What&#8217;s most noteworthy, however, aside from this unusual (and slightly nauseating!) VC love-in, is that each firm is being represented at Partner or Principal level. In other words, by the people that actually make the decisions.</p>
<p>The office hours are being held at <a target="_blank" href="http://whitebearyard.com/#/locate-us-copy2/4540684229">White Bear Yard</a>, this Wednesday 24th of October, between 2-4pm. Slots are still available &#8212; ten minutes each &#8212; so I suggest that if you&#8217;re a local startup or can make it to London, <a target="_blank" href="http://ohours.org/officehours/16764">you grab one quickly</a>.</p>
<p>The full list of VCs represented is as follows:</p>
<p>Passion Capital (all 3 partners)<br />
Index Ventures (principal)<br />
Balderton (principal)<br />
PROFounders (partner)<br />
Notion Capital (partner)<br />
Eden Ventures (partner)<br />
Connect Ventures (2 partners)<br />
EC1 Capital (partner)<br />
#1Seed (partner)<br />
Accel Partners<br />
Playfair Capital</p>
<p>I&#8217;m told that the idea of a joint office hours on such a scale, came about when Index Ventures and Passion Capital began talking about doing something together and it escalated from there. Of the well-known London VCs, notably missing in action is DFJ Esprit, though I&#8217;m assured this is purely down to calendar availability and that we can expect more combined office hours in the future, with one already being planned for December 11th.</p>
