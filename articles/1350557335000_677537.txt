Net sales for the quarter were €7.239 billion ($9.49 billion).</p>
<p>Nokia said sales of its Lumia line of Windows Phone 7-based smartphones decreased quarter-on-quarter to 2.9 million units (down from four million in the previous quarter) &#8212; attributing this decline to the looming launch of Windows Phone 8-based devices due at the end of the month.</p>
<p>Total smartphone sales were 6.3 million. While sales of its Series 40-based Asha range totalled 155 million.</p>
<p>The company also noted shrinking cash reserves. Nokia&#8217;s net cash fell to €3.6 billion ($4.7 billion) by the end of the quarter, down from €4.2 billion in June.</p>
<p>Commenting on the results, Nokia CEO Stephen Elop said in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>As we expected, Q3 was a difficult quarter in our Devices &amp; Services business; however, we are pleased that we shifted Nokia Group to operating profitability on a non-IFRS basis.</p>
<p>In Q3, we continued to manage through a tough transitional quarter for our smart devices business as we shared the exciting innovation ahead with our new line of Lumia products.</p>
<p>In our mobile phones business, the positive consumer response to our new Asha full touch smartphones translated into strong sales. And in Q3, our mobile phones business delivered a solid quarter with sequential sales growth and improved contribution margin.</p>
<p>In Location &amp; Commerce, we made progress establishing our platform offering with customers like Amazon. This is in line with our plan to expand our location offering to more customers.</p>
<p>And, Nokia Siemens Networks had a remarkable quarter in which we achieved record profitability on a non-IFRS basis and the Nokia Siemens Networks cash balance increased for the fourth quarter in a row.</p>
<p>While we continue to focus on transitioning Nokia, we are determined to carefully manage our financial resources, improve our competitiveness, return our Devices &amp; Services business to positive operating cash flow as quickly as possible, and ultimately provide more value to our shareholders.</p></blockquote>
