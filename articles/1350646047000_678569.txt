Belay that order for the $249 Samsung Chromebook! There&#8217;s a 3G model coming and it&#8217;s just $329. That&#8217;s a great deal.</p>
<p>For some reason Samsung and Google did not announce this upcoming model <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/18/chromebook-samsung-249/">alongside the $249, WiFi-only model</a> yesterday. The 3G model was found within <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-XE303C12-H01US-Chromebook-3G-11-6-Inch/dp/B009M2YNWI/ref=br_lf_m_2858603011_1_1_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;s=pc&amp;pf_rd_p=1407236782&amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_i=2858603011&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=1PBG16A3B53F4EGTJ0N1">the bowels of Amazon</a>. Spec-wise, it&#8217;s the same Chromebook with the notable addition of a 3G modem.</p>
<p>Details about the wireless plan are still missing. Previous 3G Chromebooks could use 100MB of Verizon data monthly for two years. No word if this Chromebook ships with the same deal.</p>
<p>This model presumably ships with the same killer deal of 100GB of Google Drive storage for two years &#8212; that&#8217;s a $120 value.</p>
<p>Samsung&#8217;s latest Chromebooks are decent computers, employing a dual-core A15-based Samsung Exynos 5 Dual (5250) SoC, 2GB RAM, 16GB of built-in flash storage, WiFi a/b/g/n and Bluetooth. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/10/18/google-11-6-inch-arm-based-samsung-chromebook-hands-on/">Engadget found</a> the WiFi model to be &#8220;80 percent of the entry-level MacBook Air experience for a quarter of the price.&#8221; And soon, buyers will have the option to buy a Chromebook with integrated 3G &#8212; an option not found on any MacBook Air models.</p>
