The law was hastily developed in response to a string of reports last Spring of employers coercing applicants to &#8220;voluntarily&#8221; <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/23/facebook-considering-new-laws-and-legal-action-against-employers-asking-for-users-passwords/">allow businesses to snoop</a> through their Facebook accounts as part of the interviewing process. The United States <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/28/house-shoots-down-bill-that-would-have-stopped-employers-from-demanding-your-facebook-password/">House of Representatives failed</a> in an attempt to ratify a Federal ban, paving the way for states to take up the responsibility.</p>
<p>Universities and scholarships <a target="_blank" href="http://redtape.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/03/06/10585353-govt-agencies-colleges-demand-applicants-facebook-passwords">were also found</a> with sophisticated procedures around monitoring current athletes and student applicants. The University of North Carolina handbook for sports explained,&#8221;Each team must identify at least one coach or administrator who is responsible for having access to and regularly monitoring the content of team members’ social networking sites and postings.&#8221;</p>
<p>Facebook responded to the media frenzy by reminding schools, governments, and businesses that giving away passwords was expressly forbidden by their security rules.</p>
<p>Hoping to help Facebook end the practice, the bill will go into effect January 1st.</p>
