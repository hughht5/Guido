The final price it paid for Instagram was $715 million in stock and cash. Despite rumors that it has stopped growing in mature markets, Facebook&#8217;s US user count did increase slightly from 168 million to 171 million monthly users during Q3. And the amount of people who accessed Facebook solely from mobile each month grew 24% to 126 million in since June 30th.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Instagram was bought for $300 million cash plus $221 million in vested shares and $194 million (aggregate fair value) in unvested shares. That totals up to $715 million. That number is not listed anywhere in the 10-Q, but it&#8217;s well under the $1 billion Facebook would have paid if it&#8217;s share price hadn&#8217;t slipped.</p>
<p>As for mobile-only growth, Facebook wrote in its 10-Q: &#8220;Approximately 126 million mobile MAUs accessed Facebook solely through mobile apps or our mobile website during the month ended September 30, 2012, increasing 24% from 102 million during the month ended June 30, 2012.&#8221;</p>
<p>That means the trend is accelerating, as Facebook saw a 23% increase in mobile only users from 83 million in March to 102 million in June.While it made 14% of its ad revenue from mobile in Q3, it has to keep up with users.</p>
<p>And now onto mature market growth. While some third-party measurement services said Facebook has ceased to grow in its premium markets, Facebook refuted that fact, noting &#8220;We had 171 million MAUs in the United States as of September 30, 2012, an increase of 8% compared to the same period in 2011&#8243;, and an increase of 1.71% from 168 million as of June 30th.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s surely not stunning growth, as Facebook is hitting its saturation point in the US. Instead of boosting its bottom line by increasing its user count, Facebook must now look to increase the average revenue per user in mature markets. Facebook Gifts, its entrance into ecommerce, is squarely aimed at growing ARPU by getting users to pay it directly.</p>
