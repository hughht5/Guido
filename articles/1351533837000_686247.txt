This allows Windows Phone 8 users to parcel up their contacts so they send group messages to particular sub-sets of people, share location, calendars, shared to-do lists and more.</p>
<p>WP8 will include a Family Room as standard but users can create Rooms for any contacts. &#8221;A  Family Room is part of Windows Phone 8 right out of the box,&#8221; said Joe Belfiore. Room are designed to “gather people into sets away from the crowd… perfect for close friends, immediate family.”</p>
<p>Microsoft is also including support for Windows Phone 7 and Apple iPhone users &#8212; so that Rooms don&#8217;t have to be exclusively populated by WP8 owners.</p>
<p>Below (right) is the calendar view an iPhone owner will see when they participate in a WP8 Room</p>
