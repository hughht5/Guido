He&#8217;s best known for his work with <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/30/digg-v1-ahead-of-relaunch/">Digg</a>, during its heyday, as well as Revision3. After moving into the CEO position at SimpleGeo, which has since been <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/13/with-simplegeos-shutdown-imminent-parse-swoops-in-with-a-life-preserver/">acquired by Urban Airship</a>, we&#8217;re told that Adelson is ready to make another run at a startup.</p>
<p>Multiple sources tell us that Adelson posted in a private Facebook group for former Digg employees last night, suggesting that he&#8217;s re-entering the startup world, and is doing some recruiting as well.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Adelson for comment, and if you&#8217;ve heard anything, please do send it over to drew@techcrunch.com</p>
<p>If Adelson is indeed working on a new startup, it will be interesting to see which vertical he settles in on. Having done quite a bit to democratize news with Digg as CEO, video publishing and production, working on data infrastructure and geo-location, something equally big isn&#8217;t out of the question. So it&#8217;s stealth mode for now, until we&#8217;re told differently.</p>
<p>I for one am happy to see Adelson back in the game.</p>
