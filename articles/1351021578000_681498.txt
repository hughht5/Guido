<p>Created by programmer Christian Hresko, the app allows you to create events using a mobile interface and notify friends that they&#8217;ve been invited. You can add photos of the location, check invitation histories, and friends without Inviteful will receive SMSes if they&#8217;ve been invited. It also syncs with iCloud.</p>
<p>Hresko says that the goal is to offer a mobile-only interface for adding invitees on the fly. He was a senior software engineer at Sony Ericsson and worked for 8tracks and ngmoco.</p>
<p>&#8220;This started ten weeks ago as a social calendar and quickly pivoted to an event organization tool/app,&#8221; he said. &#8220;After thinking about the event organization space, I realized this is only one part of the puzzle, which is event discovery. This first stage, Inviteful for iPhone, solves the problem of event invitations on mobile.&#8221;</p>

He bootstrapped and built the app himself over the past ten weeks. It has a very focused interface, with a who, what, where system that ensures users aren&#8217;t bogged down by extraneous UI elements. It seems like a great solution for planning off-the-cuff events like meetings for coffee, dance marathons, and sexual flash mobs.</p>
<p>The app is free and available for <a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/inviteful/id528862708?mt=8">download on iOS now</a>.</p>
