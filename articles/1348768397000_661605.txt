As part of this merger, the company is also giving Trends a fresh coat of paint and, more importantly, it&#8217;s switching to HTML5-based charts and maps based on the <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/chart/">Google Chart Tools</a>. This move, says Google, will greatly enhance the mobile Google Trends experience.</p>
<p>The new Google Trends, the company says, will wrap both products &#8220;in a clean new interface to give you a clearer view of what’s on the world’s mind.&#8221; The new product includes features from both of its predecessors and, says Google, will make &#8220;it easier and more intuitive to dig into the data.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/27/google-trends-search-insights-merger/inside-search/" rel="attachment wp-att-661666"></a>Insights for Search is now deprecated, but Google notes that it is working hard to ensure that any URL that currently points to Insights for Search will still work.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s update also expands the geographical reach of Google&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/06/find-out-what-people-are-searching-for.html">Hot Searches</a> list to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends#pn=p3">India</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends#pn=p4">Japan</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends#pn=p5">Singapore</a>. This list, which is updated once per hour, looks at which queries are being searched for more than usual . &#8217;Google&#8217; itself is the trending query that&#8217;s currently at the top of all of these lists. This, of course, isn&#8217;t necessarily a surprise, given that today is <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/27/google-marks-14-years-organizing-the-worlds-information-with-birthday-doodle/">Google&#8217;s 14th birthday</a>, an event the company is celebrating with an animated cake on its homepage.</p>
