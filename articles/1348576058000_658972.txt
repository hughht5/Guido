<blockquote><p><strong>Mobiplug Raises $2.7 Million Series A Financing Round</strong></p>
<p>Led By Foundry Group and Hires Tim Enwall as New CEO</p>
<p>Boulder, CO- September 25, 2012 – Mobiplug Networks Inc., a recent TechStars Boulder 2012 graduate, has secured $2.7 million in Series A funding led by Foundry Group. Additional strategic investors include Bullet Time Ventures, SK Ventures, Social Leverage, Clarion Direct Investment, and others. The company also named seasoned entrepreneur, Tim Enwall, as new Chief Executive Officer. As part of the round, Foundry Group’s Ryan McIntyre will be joining Mobiplug’s Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Fresh out of TechStars Boulder 2012 summer class, Mobiplug offers an affordable all-in-one home monitoring and control solution. Mobiplug makes the smart home a reality for mass market consumers with easy-to-use iPhone and iPad apps, enabling hundreds of off-the-shelf smart household items from retailers such as Amazon, Home Depot, Lowe’s, and Best Buy. The Mobiplug applications, associated web services and enabling equipment allow homeowners to achieve comfort, convenience, peace of mind and conservation right from their smartphones, home or away, with a single application experience. These services will also be available to developers who want to create their own immersive home monitoring and control experience.</p>
<p>“As a TechStars mentor and advisor to Mobiplug this past summer, I was really impressed by the co-founders and their ability to solve the thorny technical and interoperability problems that are currently holding back the home monitoring and control and Internet of Things (IoT) industry from mass adoption,” said Foundry Group Managing Partner, Ryan McIntyre. “And when Tim Enwall decided to join Mobiplug, we felt confident that the addition of his experience and leadership to this already talented core team could really disrupt the market and lead this growing space.”</p>
<p>Incoming Mobiplug CEO, Tim Enwall, was a mentor-in-residence at TechStars and brings with him a wealth of entrepreneurial leadership experience. Tim previously founded and was the CEO, COO and then CIO of Tendril, which monitors home energy usage and assists users in managing their energy. He has successfully founded, built, and sold two other technology startups and invested in a dozen more. He has a passion for improving the quality of people’s lives through technology.</p>
<p>“I’m honored to be joining and leading such a strong team at Mobiplug, whose roots in this space span more than a decade of experience. We are solving the foundational barrier to mass scale home monitoring and convenience; something I learned a great deal about while at Tendril. I’m also excited by the team of investors that we have in our corner, and thrilled to be working side by side with Ryan and Foundry Group,” said CEO Tim Enwall. “Thanks to the confidence shown by our investors, we have the capital necessary to grow our team and execute our ambitious goals.”</p>
<p>“Getting wirelessly-enabled household items like locks, thermostats, lights, outlets and shades made by different manufacturers and based on different protocols to talk to each other is an enormous problem to solve, which is keeping this market from exploding. We’re fixing that.” said Enwall. “To do so, we are hiring the best talent available.” Mobiplug is recruiting top talent in mobile development (iOS and Android), mobile UX, mobile UI, cloud platform, and wireless protocol and embedded Linux engineering. The company is located in downtown Boulder, CO, offers competitive salaries, a fun work environment, full benefits and home monitoring and control perks for all employees.
