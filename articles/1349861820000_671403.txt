The short version is as follows: Push on with Rest of the World (ROW) domination &#8212; launching in 76 additional countries throughout Africa, the Middle East and Asia &#8212; as the company continues scaling up it strategy of everywhere <em>but</em> the U.S., along with adding a marketing-driven free version of the service and ramping up its social features significantly. </p>
<p><em>More to follow&#8230;</em></p>
<p>The details were outlined by Deezer CEO Axel Dauchez, at a press conference held, appropriately, at Abbey Road Studios (made famous by the Beatles) and build on much of what he told TechCrunch in an <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/09/deezer-ceo-streaming-music/">interview</a> he gave yesterday.</p>
<p>Specifically, Dauchez talked about how the company plans to spend its new capital.</p>
<p>It plans to &#8220;speed up growth&#8221; by opening offices in both new and existing markets around the world, in order to strike deals with the local right holders. The big bet here is that the switch from &#8220;music ownership to usage&#8221; (downloads to cloud-based consumption i.e. subscription streaming) will increase the importance of &#8220;new&#8221; music markets &#8212; those exact same markets that Deezer is set to have first-mover advantage in.</p>
<p>Deezer also plans to grow its editorial team by 50% (specific head count wasn&#8217;t given) to further improve the localisation of its service and to provide more locally relevant content and features &#8212; this is an area the company thinks it competes on really well and will be instrumental in creating a market for the service locally.</p>
<p>But, perhaps headline grabbing of them all, is the planned launch of an international free service, something that has been missing till now. Similar to Spotify, the idea here is that the free service will be a recruitment channel to encourage free service users to convert to paid subscription (&#8220;rather than a model in of itself&#8221;, says the company). Furthermore, it will be tailored for each individual country &#8220;according to the competition&#8221;, presumably in terms of number of listening hours permitted and that type of thing.</p>
<p>A strategy is one thing &#8212; words in a business plan always sound great &#8212; but Deezer has been busy putting some serious meat on the bone. Tangible evidence of this lies in today&#8217;s announcement that the service has launched in 76 additional countries throughout Africa, the Middle East and Asia &#8212; this brings Deezerâ€™s reach to a total of 160 countries worldwide, more than any of its competitors, notes the company. But this really is a Rest of the World play &#8212; the U.S. is still missing in action, and Deezer says it will continue to focus first on growing music markets, rather than the U.S., &#8220;where customer acquisition costs are high and market conditions do not currently allow for sustainable expansion&#8221;. Music streaming is never cheap.</p>
