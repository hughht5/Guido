<p>With all the hullaballoo surrounding the new <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/23/ipad-mini/">iPad Mini</a>, it&#8217;s worth remembering that some actual Windows-flavored competition is ready to roll. We learned last week that Microsoft spent quite some time in a self-described <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/16/microsoft-surface/">Willy Wonka type studio</a>, carefully crafting the clicky, compact <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/16/microsoft-surface-rt-priced-32gb-for-499-without-touch-cover-599-with-64gb-for-699/">Windows 8 tablet</a>. And one of its most special, and most important, features is the Touch Cover, which doubles as a tablet cover and a keyboard all in one 3mm package.</p>
<p>Microsoft today released a video that goes into more detail about the Touch Cover&#8217;s creation. As you may remember from the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/16/microsoft-surface-rt-priced-32gb-for-499-without-touch-cover-599-with-64gb-for-699/">original tour</a> through Studio B, a lot of attention went into the noises of the tablet, namely the soft clicking sound when the touch cover attaches.</p>
<p>Microsoft also showed off the Type Cover, which is essentially a 6mm cover with a scissor key keyboard. It has all the same &#8220;smart&#8221; functionality as the Touch Cover, but with a bit more familiarity when typing.</p>
<p>However, an engineer in the video explains that, with the Touch Cover, &#8220;there isn&#8217;t a huge learning curve with respect to muscle memory of where your fingers are striking the keys.&#8221; We&#8217;ll have to wait until full reviews are released to find out.</p>
<p>Microsoft Surface RT is already available for pre-order and becomes available on October 26.</p>
