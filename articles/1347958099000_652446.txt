The premise being that friends of existing employees make the best potential job candidates. And so it is that another offering outs its social recruitment wares: Today sees the launch of Berlin-based <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jobs-for-friends.com">Jobs For Friends</a> &#8212; the product of longtime e-recruitment company <a target="_blank" href="http://www.softgarden.de/en/">Softgarden</a>.</p>
<p>Jobs For Friends follows a familiar format: Recruiters and hiring managers within a company post a job description/ad on the platform, which they then share with their colleagues via an email invitation pointing to the specific job page. From here, those employees are prompted to share the job within their own networks, with options for Twitter, Linkedin, Xing, and Facebook. It&#8217;s then hoped that some of those trusted friends will choose to apply and/or ask for more information about the role and what it&#8217;s like to work at said company.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a degree of gamification too (hello, Zao et. al) as employees earn points for helping to spread the word and, I&#8217;m told, those points can eventually be redeemed in Jobs For Friends&#8217; &#8220;shopping community&#8221;. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/28/youre-funded-zao-raises-1-3m-for-its-social-recruitment-platform/">Unlike</a>, Zao, however, Jobs For Friends doesn&#8217;t take a cut of any prize money (or its monetary equivalent). Instead, the company simply charges €69 for each one-month job listing.</p>
<p>Additionally, each job has a sort of social &#8216;page&#8217; itself, providing an activity feed to show who has &#8216;endorsed&#8217; which job &#8212; see <a target="_blank" href="http://jobs-for-friends.com/softgarden/">example</a>.</p>
<p>Jobs For Friends is founded by Dominik Faber and Stefan Schüffler. Of interest, Faber is also founder of Booklets, the &#8216;social collections&#8217; platform that I wrote about <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/10/now-with-sound-social-collections-platform-booklets-integrates-with-soundcloud/">recently</a>.</p>
