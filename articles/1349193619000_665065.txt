The company is hosting a three-day, expense-paid immersion program at Squareâ€™s San Francisco headquarters called Code Camp. Engineering students can <a target="_blank" href="https://squareup.com/form/f1f6b2cc31f">submit</a> a resume and essays about why they would like to be a part of the program online and 15 female winners will be selected to participate.</p>
<p>Square says the three-day program will include conversations and mentorship sessions with Square leaders, hands-on workshops with teams from across the company, Q&amp;A sessions, as well as tours around the beautiful and historic Bay Area. Contest winners will be flown to San Francisco and provided accommodations during their stay.</p>
<p>Students have to be enrolled as a full-time student at a university in the US or Canada and must be pursuing a degree in computer science, computer engineering or a related technical major.</p>
<p>Square joins a number of other companies in launching initiatives to help support female engineers. Twitter has been <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/03/twitter-bets-on-girls-who-code/">actively supporting Girls Who Code, </a> a new, New York-based initiative designed to help teach girls how to code so that they can pursue careers in technology and engineering.</p>
