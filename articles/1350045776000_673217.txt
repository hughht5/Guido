The collaboration is part of a new initiative by Rovio to use the power of the Angry Birds brand as a learning aid. The Finnish company has kicked off a learning programme &#8212; under a new brand, called Angry Birds Playground (not to be confused with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lappset.com/global/en/Products/Angry_Birds_Activity_Parks.iw3">Angry Birds activity parks</a>) &#8211; for 3 to 8-year-olds based on the Finnish National Curriculum for kindergarten.</p>
<p>Rovio told TechCrunch the collaboration will involve co-producing learning support materials with CERN &#8212; including, initially, books and a board game. More products will be added later, the company said. We&#8217;ve also reached out to CERN to ask for more details and will update with any response.</p>
<p>&#8220;Modern physics has been around for 100 years, but it’s still a mystery to many people. Working together with Rovio, we can teach kids quantum physics by making it fun and easy to understand,&#8221; said CERN&#8217;s Head of Education, Rolf Landua, speaking at the Frankfurt Book Fair where the Rovio launch took place.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s a great fit for both sides, combining physics and Angry Birds in a fun way. Rovio has a great platform, with a broad reach and highly engaged fans, which makes this collaboration very promising. With Rovio and Angry Birds Playground, we get a great channel to communicate what CERN does,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Playground products, kids can have fun and learn more about physics than they would&#8217;ve in the &#8216;old-fashioned&#8217; style of learning,&#8221; added Peter Vesterbacka, Rovio Mighty Eagle and CMO, in a statement.</p>
<p>Rovio&#8217;s Angry Birds-fuelled merchandising empire includes plans for a non-educational line of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/20/move-over-dr-seuss-rovio-readies-angry-birds-kids-books-partners-with-publisher-egmont/">Angry Birds kids&#8217; books</a>, in collaboration with Egmont Publishing, and &#8212; most recently &#8212; its <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/04/rovio-flies-into-frankfurt-to-unveil-its-first-book-app-expect-lots-of-pigs-maybe-an-angry-bird-or-two/">first book app</a> &#8211; along with t-shirts, plush toys, theme parks and more.</p>
