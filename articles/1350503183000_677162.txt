But in any community made up of millions of people, some bad apples are going to turn up.</p>
<p>So today, Pinterest announced a new feature that lets people block other users and report bad activity on the site. Users can report specific pins or other users&#8217; profiles entirely. These features will roll out over the next week, Pinterest says. In a <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.pinterest.com/post/33785122869/announcing-blocking-more-controls">company blog post</a> published today, Pinterest software engineer Dannie Chu writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;People use Pinterest to discover new ideas and be inspired by a community who share similar interests. We’ve recently added the ability to block and report a user to help keep our community positive and respectful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Along with the ability to block and report a user, Pinterest has also added more granular email settings that let people dictate when they receive notifications about things like repinning and commenting activity.</p>
