To date, SnapLogic has raised a total of $32.5 million from Andreessen Horowitz, Maples Investments, Hit Forge, Triangle Peak Partners and angel investors. Frank Artale of Ignition Partners will join SnapLogic’s board of directors, which includes Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s Ben Horowitz.</p>
<p>As companies adopt new cloud and SaaS applications, SnapLogic helps them integrate the cloud quickly while also ensuring interoperability across a complex range of on-premise legacy applications. Organizations can connect any combination of applications or data sources.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s CEO Gaurav Dhillon tells us the company was founded back in 2007 on the premise that the enterprise would embrace the cloud. &#8220;We help businesses connect cloud applications to on-premise applications that were installed in the past,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;We&#8217;re the on-ramp to the cloud for enterprises everywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>For example, if you have customers in Salesforce, but have your financials in an on-premise solution, SnapLogic will help you integrate that data in your SRM with your financial system.</p>
<p>“We continue to be impressed by the strong momentum SnapLogic is gaining as it moves forward a new vision for enterprise integration,” said Horowitz, in a release. “Gaurav pioneered this industry years ago with Informatica, and is reinventing it today with SnapLogic’s innovative cloud architecture and the ability to containerize all kinds of data through its ubiquitous Snaps.”</p>
<p>&#8220;One of key factors of our success is that our system works with most cloud applications and on-premise systems,&#8221; says Dhillon.</p>
<p>SnapLogic says that its integration infrastructure and SnapStore scale quickly and integrate data via a drag and drop visual designer, over 150 intelligent connectors (called Snaps), and APIs. Enterprise can also build their own &#8220;snaps&#8221; to connect applications. Customers include the U.S. federal government and companies in game publishing, industrial goods, network broadcasting, consumer electronics retailing, casual dining, and Internet radio. For example, a large restaurant chain is using SnapLogic connect their data from their point of sale terminals to applications in the cloud.</p>
