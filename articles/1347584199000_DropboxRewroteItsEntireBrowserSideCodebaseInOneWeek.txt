The rewrite was done to translate all of its JavaScript into a language called <a target="_blank" href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>.</p>
<p>CoffeeScript is a language that compiles into JavaScript. It offers an alternative syntax that looks more Python or Ruby, with the goal of enabling &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate programming</a>,&#8221; an approach to writing code that&#8217;s meant to be more human readable.</p>
<p>The language has generated considerable controversy in the JavaScript community, but has many supporters, including JavaScript creator Brendan Eich. Eich spoke highly of CoffeeScript at <a target="_blank">JSConf 2011</a>, which he co-keynoted with CoffeeScript creator Jeremy Ashkenas. Eich has been working to <a target="_blank" href="https://brendaneich.com/2011/05/my-jsconf-us-presentation/">bring some of the syntax of CoffeeScript into the next version of JavaScript</a>, codenamed JSNext, and encourages developers to create their own JavaScript variants as a way to potentially improve JavaScript.</p>
<p>The Dropbox blog post addresses some of the common complains about CoffeeScript, including performance and debugging. According to the blog post: &#8220;The size of the compressed bundle didn’t change significantly pre- and post-coffee transformation, so our users shouldn’t notice anything different. The site performs and behaves as before.&#8221; They also did extensive testing of the code changes during the week to make sure nothing broke.</p>
<p>The team used <a target="_blank" href="http://js2coffee.org/">js2coffee</a>, an automatic conversion tool, to speed up the process. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a before and after example from Dropbox:</p>
