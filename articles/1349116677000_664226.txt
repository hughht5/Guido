And it now seems other companies are jumping on the TV bandwagon. A German company now plans to use TV to launch new tech companies &#8211; but there&#8217;s a twist. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://en.prosiebensat1.com/en/activities/germany/sevenventures">SevenVentures</a>, the venture subsidiary of the ProSiebenSat.1 Group, plans to run a pitch competition for startups, the prize for which will be millions of Euros worth of advertising time on Germany&#8217;s biggest TV network. </p>
<p>The &#8220;SevenVentures Pitch Day&#8221; will take place during the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.noah-conference.com/">NOAH Conference</a> on November 6 – 7, 2012, in London, TV. But the prize is not cash but TV advertising time valued at €7 million. Thus the winner of 1st place wins €4 million, 2nd wins €2 million and 3rd place €1 million. We&#8217;re told the high amounts involved reflect the fact that the ad slots will be in prime-time slots. </p>
<p>Applying startups will have to be younger than three years old in the consumer space. So no B2B kids. And they don&#8217;t just want German start-ups but also international ones that want to enter the German-speaking market. A group of seven teams will be pre-selected for the pitch day, which will be live streamed and judged by &#8220;6 tech scene veterans&#8221; and the audience both in the venue and online. The submission deadline for applications is October 21 st, 2012.</p>
<p>The main upside for the startups is that SevenVentures is not asking for any equity, so if you win you&#8217;d get  €4 million of free TV ads. The problem of course is that you&#8217;d still have to spend cash on making the TV ad in the first place, plus it might just not be the right thing for your company. TV ads can be a double-edged sword. Furthermore, an international startup wanting to appeal in Germany would have to quickly re-tool their app and/or/site for the German language, entailing costs. Then again, it could be a great shot in the arm for a young company. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s likely that this is going to appeal to startups which are up and running and already have investors &#8211; in which case SevenVentures might find its offer of further funding might fall of deaf ears. </p>
<p>Personally I&#8217;m waiting for the &#8220;German Tech Idol&#8221; &#8211; perhaps Simon Cowell is onto something after all.</p>
