The Firefox Marketplace is similar to the Google&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/home">Web Store for Chrome</a>. Users can browse the store to find mobile web apps and developers can showcase their web apps. These apps run in full-screen mode and can also be pinned to the home screen. <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.mozilla.org/app/distant-orbit/">Distant Orbit</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.mozilla.org/app/jauntly/?src=mkt-ppage">Jauntly</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.mozilla.org/app/soundcloud/?src=mkt-ppage">Soundcloud</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.mozilla.org/app/twitter/">Twitter</a> are among the first apps in the store, where all the apps are currently available for free.</p>
<p>As Firefox engineering manager Bill Walker notes in <a target="_blank" href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/10/firefox-marketplace-aurora/">the announcement today</a>, the goal behind this early release is to &#8220;collect as much real-life feedback as possible about the Marketplaceâ€™s design, usability, performance, reliability, and content.&#8221; He also stresses that this is meant to be an open ecosystem, where &#8220;users have choices and developers have control over their content, functionality and distribution.&#8221; In order to facilitate this open ecosystem, Firefox offers developers <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Apps">number of APIs</a> for app <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.mozilla.org/developers/submit/app">submissions</a>, payments and app discovery.</p>
<p>Mozilla hopes that the Firefox Marketplace will &#8220;allow developers to build, distribute and monetize rich, immersive apps that use Web technologies like HTML, JavaScript and CSS.&#8221; To get developers started, Mozilla recently published a design guide and a number of <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.mozilla.org/developers/docs/tutorial_general">tutorials</a>.</p>
<p>After this early release, the Marketplace will slowly make its way through Firefox&#8217;s Aurora and Beta releases. In addition, it will also become a cornerstone of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefoxos/">Firefox OS</a>, Mozilla&#8217;s budding operating system for mobile devices.</p>
