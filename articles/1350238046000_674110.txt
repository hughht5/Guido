That would have been awesome.</p>

<p>Not only would it have been a great use of Google Glass, but it would have given us a perspective that only Felix himself would ever see.</p>

<p><b>UPDATE:</b> The jump has been made and it was successful. Felix is safe and world records have been broken. Now excuse me, I need to buy and drink a Red Bull or 9.</p>
