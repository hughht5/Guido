That would have been <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/27/sergey-brin-demos-google-glass-at-io/">awesome&#8230;again</a>.</p>
<p>Can you imagine seeing what Felix&#8217;s eyes were seeing as he was falling? And then, you know&#8230;answering questions on Google+ Hangouts and checking your tweets by winking your eye or something. Maybe next time, Red Bull? There will be a next time, right?</p>

<p>Not only would it have been a great use of Google Glass, but it would have given us a perspective that only Felix himself would ever see.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.redbullstratos.com/live/">Watch live.</a> Over 8 million viewers watched the stream on YouTube. What a hell of a Google+ Hangout, eh?</p>
<p>If you want, you can <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bike/3404792548/">make your own</a> until they&#8217;re widely available:</p>

<p><b>UPDATE:</b> The jump has been made and it was successful. Felix is safe and world records have been broken. Now excuse me, I need to buy and drink a Red Bull or 9.</p>
