That&#8217;s why the internet, namely Twitter, can be such a spurious environment. We sometimes forget that with the real-time, viral benefits of the short-winded social network come the same negative effects. Truth can spread like wildfire, and so can lies.</p>
<p>Today, the Bieber nation has learned that lesson. Behold, dear readers, the horror.</p>
<p>The story goes that Entertainment Weekly&#8217;s verified Twitter account tweeted out the following:</p>
<p>&#8220;Pop Star Justin Bieber was diagnosed with cancer earlier this morning. Bieber fans are shaving their heads to show their support.&#8221;</p>
<p>Justin apparently responded back saying thanks for the support, and a picture of the Twitter conversation along with two images of bald Bieber fans started making its way on the internet.</p>
<p>In reality, 4chan was trolling Beliebers. There were no tweets to begin with, and there definitely isn&#8217;t any cancer. 4chan peeps simply photoshopped together an image and sent it out into the world.</p>
<p>Unfortunately now, there are likely dozens of bald tweenage girls crying in their bathrooms. And it&#8217;s perhaps even more insane that most members of the Bieber nation still believe that Justin has cancer, and are pouring sympathy, condolences, and heartfelt love into the <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23baldforbeiber&amp;src=hash">#baldforbeiber</a> hashtag, despite the fact that the other half of that Twitter conversation is lawling over the hoax.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen this type of Twitter misuse cause problems before. Morgan Freeman and his delicious voice were <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/398571/20121026/morgan-freeman-dead-hoax-jokes-twitter-facebook.htm">rumored to be dead</a>, and that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2212345/Kara-Alongi-Missing-Twitter-hoax-teen-posted-fake-plea-help-online-FOUND-safe-day-search.html">NJ girl scared the crap out of everyone</a> when she said there was an invader in her house on Twitter. (Really, she just was running away from home.)</p>
<p>In any case, this should serve as an excellent reminder to all of us. Just because you read it on Twitter, doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s true.</p>
