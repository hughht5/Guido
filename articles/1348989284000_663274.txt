<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/techcrunchitaly.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="TechCrunchItaly" title="TechCrunchItaly" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Last year Italy’s official statistics bureau, ISTAT, <a target="_blank" href="http://articles.businessinsider.com/2011-12-28/europe/30564307_1_broadband-connections-internet-connections#ixzz27eFxHfGA">produced a report</a> on the state of the internet in Italy. It found that in world terms, Italy was below average in terms of Internet usage.  The European average is 73% usage by population, but Italians were hovering around the 63% mark. But official statistics can be cruel and out of date &#8211; and it&#8217;s clear now to any observer on the ground that whatever is happening in the home market, Italian tech startups aren&#8217;t just shooting for their own country but for yours as well. Evidence of this emerged when <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/04/facebook-buys-location-based-discovery-app-glancee/">Facebook bought Italy-based Glancee</a>, this year &#8211; this was the location based mobile story of the year. And there have been other undercurrents. The Italian Startup Scene Facebook Group which <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_163895500288173&amp;ap=1">now has over 8,300 members</a>, up from less than 3,000 last year &#8211; is still growing. Clearly many of the old attitudes are changing fast, and are probably out of date as we speak. For instance, the TechCrunch Italy CrunchUp event in Rome this last week was originally supposed to be a simple meetup. But it&#8217;s a sign that Italy&#8217;s startup eco-system has exploded in the last 18 months or so that we ended up having to find a venue for over 1,000 people who wanted to come. Italy has clearly changed since I scratched around a tiny Italian-only event in 2008.</p>
<p>And it is the young people who are driving the change, as well as forcing politicians &#8211; usually obsessed with the economic crisis &#8211; to sit up and take notice. Refreshingly, the Italian government hasn&#8217;t been sitting on it&#8217;s hands. The business minister is currently prepping new legislation dubbed &#8220;Startup Italia&#8221; which should be passed in early October. A huge consultation process happened on the campus of investor <a target="_blank" href="http://www.h-farmventures.com/en/">H-Farm</a>, where a number of Italian startups and VCs could contribute. Eventually the legislation is hoped to include new tax breaks for Angel investors and a new kind of limited company allowing for faster hiring and firing compared to traditional companies. </p>
<p>Much of this has been initiated after a report called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sviluppoeconomico.gov.it/images/stories/documenti/layout_startup_summary-versione-inglese.pdf">Restart Italia</a>, drawn up by the fask force established<br />
by the Minister of Economic Development Corrado Passera. The report suggested that startups needed more support in Italy and could boost economic growth and employment, especially among the young and could have a widespread impact on Italian society. </p>
<p>But it hasn&#8217;t all been plain-sailing as the largely conservative Italian culture and society has not always been welcoming to tech entrepreneurs. This, despite it&#8217;s long history of fascination with cutting edge fashion designers exhibiting on the catwalks of Milan and it&#8217;s well-earned reputation as a crucible of innovation in the world&#8217;s leading high performance sports cars.</p>
<p>But the signs of the times are changing. Regional governments within Italy &#8211; which often have more autonomy than central government  &#8211; are dreaming up their own initiatives outside the dead-locked corridors of Rome. Perhaps one of the fastest moving is the tiny regional state of Trentino around the city of Trento. A semi-autonomous region which effectively makes it own rules, it is currently putting into a place a scheme called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.trentorise.eu/">Trento Rise</a>, which is planning to launch a scheme to incubate over 100 companies from all over Europe in partnership with other Italian accelerators. It&#8217;s no coincidence that hits head, Prof. Fausto Giunchiglia, once worked at Stanford University. And because Trentino&#8217;s local government can raise it&#8217;s own taxes, some years ago it decided pump its wealth into innovation initiatives, allocating close to 3% of its provincial GDP to research. By contrast the national Italian government as a whole puts just 1% of GDP into research. The result ha been that Trentino is one of Italy&#8217;s wealthiest regions and almost sealed off from the economic pain in the rest of the country.</p>
<p>Tiny Trento is also part of the European Union backed project called the <a target="_blank" href="http://eit.europa.eu/kics/eit-ict-labs/">European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) ICT Labs</a>, along with Stockholm, Paris, Berlin, Helsinki, Paris, Einhoven. This means it has access to millions of Euros in funding to promote real-world spin out companies from academic research at Master and PhD level.</p>
<p>Thus, at the TechCrunch Italy event this week, the buzz was palpable in the venue, a reproduction of Shakespeare&#8217;s Globe Theatre in London, created 10 years ago by an Italian entrepreneur. Some highlights of the day included appearances by Rome City officials and the Italian business minister to support the event. And the fact that Alec Ross, Senior Advisor for Innovation to Hillary Clinton took time out to speak about how to create a society and culture that is open to startups and innovation. Despite the Wi-Fi not holding up and the weather being too hot, most agreed it was a great event, attracting pan-european VCs such as Index Ventures, Doughty Hanson and Balderton Capital.</p>
<p></p>
<p>During the day we had 50 speakers, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.techcrunch-italy.com/speaker/">speakers</a>, a great <a target="_blank" href="http://www.techcrunch-italy.com/agenda/">agenda</a>, a startup <a target="_blank" href="http://www.techcrunch-italy.com/startup/">showcase</a>, an amazing <a target="_blank" href="http://www.techcrunch-italy.com/venue/">venue</a> and some great <a target="_blank" href="http://www.techcrunch-italy.com/sponsors/">sponsors</a>. We&#8217;re even had a hackathon organised by <a target="_blank" href="http://hackitaly.org/">Hackitaly</a>. There were almost 5,000 people on the live stream and the hashtag #TCItaly trended on Twitter in Italy.
