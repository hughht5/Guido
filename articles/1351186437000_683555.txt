<p>The deal is part of a major mobile push led by Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer. All of Stamped&#8217;s nine employees are joining the company, and are tasked with building a &#8220;major mobile development center&#8221; based in New York City that will focus on bringing much-needed coherence to Yahoo&#8217;s mobile strategy.</p>
<p>The Stamped team is starting at Yahoo today and leading a big hiring push to staff up the NYC mobile office.</p>
<p>Stamped took on $3 million in venture capital funding, and we&#8217;re working on getting the exact acquisition amount. At the moment we understand that Stamped&#8217;s employees and investors are very happy with the acquisition price. </p>
