<p>Yahoo has bought Stamped, the New York City based startup that lets people record and share their favorite restaurants, books, movies, and music, we&#8217;ve confirmed with a source at Stamped.</p>
<p>The deal is part of a major mobile push led by Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, the source tells us. All of Stamped&#8217;s nine employees are joining the company, and are taksed with building a &#8220;major mobile development center&#8221; based in New York City that will focus on bringing coherence to Yahoo&#8217;s mobile strategy.</p>
<p>Stamped took on $3 million in venture capital funding, and we&#8217;re working on getting the exact acquisition amount. At the moment we understand that Stamped&#8217;s employees and investors are very happy with the acquisition price. </p>
