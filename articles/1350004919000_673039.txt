The New York-based company now sees itself as a local search tool and check-ins are not as relevant as they used to be. Crowley considered selling the company but &#8220;it wasn&#8217;t the right move at that time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Foursquare had <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/22/facebook-and-microsoft-check-in-with-foursquare-will-crowley-sell/">multiple acquisition offers</a> over the years. &#8220;Of course we considered selling. But [Foursquare] is 10 times cooler than we expected,&#8221; Crowley said to Sarah Lacy. &#8220;I looked back once or twice in the past, but now I never look back,&#8221; he continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came up with a list of ten questions that I needed answers,&#8221; Crowley said. Among them: &#8220;What would happen if we sell the company?&#8221; &#8220;Will we get more resources?&#8221; &#8220;What our budget will look like?&#8221; In the end, &#8220;we thought about it because it&#8217;s a big deal but it wasn&#8217;t the right move at that time,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Comparatively, Austin competitor Gowalla was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/02/report-facebook-has-acquired-gowalla/">acquired by Facebook</a> in December 2011.</p>
<p>When talking about the product, &#8220;this is the best local search tool in the planet,&#8221; Crowley said. According to him, Foursquare is finally starting to use its data efficiently. &#8220;Every couple of days, it gets better,&#8221; he said. Getting to that point took a lot of time and it only happened in the last six months.</p>
<p>In the past, many people used to sign up and never check in. The company wondered if anything was broken. In fact, users didn&#8217;t want to check in, they just wanted to browse the app.</p>
<p>Crowley compared Foursquare&#8217;s trajectory to Twitter. Even though Twitter&#8217;s content is impressive, many people are just following people and reading content. Now, check-ins are not as important as actual users who browse the app and the content curated thanks to check-ins.</p>
<p>About monetization, &#8220;we just now have the tools to build the recommendation engine, to build the dashboard,&#8221; Crowley said. Promoted results in the explore tab with places around you will be an important area for revenue. &#8220;We made a lot of assumptions about what the merchants will pay for the service,&#8221; he continued. He hopes to figure it out in the coming months and to scale up.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/photo4.jpg" rel="lightbox[673039]"></a>The conversation turned to the number of users. &#8220;How many people said &#8216;I&#8217;ll never get a Facebook account,&#8217;&#8221; Crowley said. Many commenters criticized new services that are <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2006/07/15/is-twttr-interesting/">now ubiquitous</a>. &#8220;Twitter is not just for nerds and sandwiches,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>So far, Foursquare has raised <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/24/foursquare-closes-50m-at-a-600m-valuation/">$71 million</a> in venture capital since 2009 over three rounds. The company has 150 people working for it in New York and San Francisco.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve optimized [our previous funding rounds] to have amazing investors,&#8221; Crowley said. &#8220;And it&#8217;s working.&#8221; Yet, he strangely thinks that he is awful at pitching VCs. He talked to 35 people before having a &#8220;yes&#8221; for Series A funding.</p>
<p>Retrospectively, Dodgeball, Crowley&#8217;s previous startup, which was very similar to Foursquare and was acquired by Google in May 2005, wasn&#8217;t a major success, according to him. &#8220;We were a little bit ahead of our time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We had a hard time explaining what the business was,&#8221; he continued. But, at the time, working for Google was a dream come true for the team, with a cool job soon after NYU. Crowley kept joking about the free food at Google.</p>
<p>&#8220;In hindsight, we thought it was a product acquisition and they knew it was an acquihire,&#8221; he said. It was soon after Google&#8217;s IPO and tech acquisitions were very different back then. When Google killed Dodgeball, it was a wake-up call. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to build this again,&#8221; Crowley said.</p>
<p>About the early hype of Foursquare, Crowley was very humble, even if he became a personality with, for example, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/23/dennis-crowleys-mom-actually-bought-him-that-gap-ad-outfit/">the GAP ad</a>. &#8220;I dont mind [the GAP ads] if it puts the attention on Foursquare,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Back in June, Foursquare unveiled a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/06/foursquare-gets-a-new-look-redesign-makes-checking-in-stickier-and-more-social/">totally redesigned</a> version of its mobile apps, with an emphasis on discovery and on the social aspect of the app. Interactions are now easier and you can discover interesting places more easily.</p>
<p>Even though it was one of the pioneers in the check-in space and more generally in the social-local-mobile business (SoLoMo), many competitors have appeared over the years with mixed results, including <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/help/location/mobile">Facebook</a>. But Crowley now sees Yelp as the main competitor.</p>
