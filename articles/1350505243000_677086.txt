Analysts expected EPS of $0.54 and revenue of $3.4 billion for Q3 2012.</p>
<p>The company reported third quarter net income on a GAAP basis of $597 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, and non-GAAP net income of $718 million, or $0.55 per diluted share. GAAP and non-GAAP net income were up 22% and 14%, respectively, year over year due primarily to strong top-line growth, said the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had a great third quarter across our company, with Marketplaces and PayPal accelerating customer growth,&#8221; said John Donahoe, eBay Inc. President and CEO in a release. &#8220;Mobile continues to be a game changer for us, and we continue to be a clear leader in mobile commerce and payments. With our strong portfolio and global reach, we are consistently demonstrating our capabilities to help consumers shop anytime, anywhere. And we are enabling retailers of all sizes to compete in a rapidly evolving, multichannel commerce environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>PayPal ended the quarter with 117.4 million active registered accounts, a 14% increase over the third quarter of 2011. Revenue increased 23% year over year and net total payment volume (TPV) grew 20% year over year to $35.2 billion. </p>
<p>Marketplaces also saw accelerated user growth. Gross merchandise volume (GMV), excluding vehicles, increased 11% year over year to $16 billion in the third quarter of 2012. Marketplaces revenue increased 9% year over year, driven by strong growth in the United States and Asia Pacific. Active user growth continued to accelerate during the quarter, reaching 10% year over year, the fastest growth since 2007, with 800,000 new users coming from mobile.</p>
