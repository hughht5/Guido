The company made this announcement in a blog post celebrating the upcoming <a target="_blank" href="http://www.5oct.org/2012/index.php/en/">World Teachers&#8217; Day</a> on October 5.</p>
<p>Google Apps For Education launched almost <a target="_blank" href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/10/score-one-for-sun-devils.html">exactly six years ago</a>. The service seems to be growing at a rate of about 5 million new users per year. In 2010, Apps for Education had about 10 million users and last year, Google <a target="_blank" href="http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2011/10/posted-by-tom-mills-director-of.html">announced</a> that it had signed up an additional 5 million users for the service since.</p>
<p>The education edition includes all of the standard Google products like Gmail, Calendar, Good Docs and Drive. In addition schools can also make use of Vault, the company&#8217;s archiving and e-discovery solution that helps them to be prepared for internal investigations, litigation and compliance audits. Schools do not have to pay for access to Apps for Education and students get up to 25GB of storage space on Google&#8217;s servers.</p>
<p>With <a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/education/school-services.aspx">Office 365 for Education</a>, Microsoft currently offers a very similar suite of products for schools. In 2011, Microsoft said it its product (which was still called live@edu back then) had <a target="_blank" href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-10805_3-20028156-75.html">about 15 million users</a>. The company hasn&#8217;t released any new numbers since, though it <a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/emea/presscentre/pressreleases/June2012/27-06365Education.mspx">recently</a> expanded its service to Europe and announced that it had signed up over 4.5 million students through the Catholic International Education Office there as well.</p>
<p>Here are a few additional momentum numbers Google shared about its education-focused initiatives today:</p>
