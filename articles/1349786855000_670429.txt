And here we are, receiving word that the first orders for the new iPod touch with a four-inch display have already begun shipping.</p>
<p>We heard a few days ago that orders were <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/05/pre-order-customers-report-5th-generation-ipod-touch-now-preparing-to-ship/">&#8220;preparing to ship,&#8221; but according to AppleInsider, those shipments are now on their way. </a></p>
<p>Estimated delivery times for standard shipping are around next Monday, October 15. Apple has even published the iPod touch 5th generation user guide on iBooks, just in case you&#8217;re looking for a little extra info.</p>
<p>In the meantime, if you&#8217;re one of the future owners of an iPod touch, and placed your order around the middle of September, chances are your precious is on a plane or boat or some vessel from China on its way to you.</p>
<p>The only concern you should have should be whether or not Apple can keep up with demand. The iPhone 5 and iPod touch 5th gen have the same 4-inch display, and clearly the iPhone 5 is in <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/17/apple-announces-record-pre-orders-for-iphone-5-2m-in-24-hours/">high demand</a> right now.</p>
<p>Readers who received shipping notifications shared with AppleInsider on Tuesday that their orders for the new iPod touch have now shipped from China and are en route to the U.S. Estimated deliveries for standard shipping are before next Monday, Oct. 15.</p>
<p>One reader who provided detailed information on their shipment revealed that the package has been shipped via FedEx from one of the shipper&#8217;s origin facilities in Kunshan, China. That order was placed on Sept. 14.</p>
