Today Foxconn said no such strike took place and claimed production of the iPhone 5 is on schedule, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/06/us-apple-foxconn-idUSBRE8941JF20121006">Reuters</a> is reporting.</p>
<p>Earlier reports had suggested 3,000 to 4,000 workers began striking at Foxconn&#8217;s Zhengzhou complex on Friday afternoon &#8212; with the disputes apparently triggered by &#8220;over-exacting quality controls&#8221; on iPhone 5 production, compounded by a lack of worker training to meet the new, higher standards. Demands that workers also work through a week-long national holiday also caused tensions to boil over into industrial action, according to reports.</p>
<p>But Foxconn Technology Group sent Reuters a statement today denying there had been a strike. It said two brief and small disputes took place at the plant in question, several days earlier, but claimed these were &#8220;immediately addressed&#8221; and did not escalate into an &#8220;employee strike&#8221;. Additional staff were also provided for &#8220;the lines in question&#8221;, it added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any reports that there has been an employee strike are inaccurate,&#8221; Reuters quotes Foxconn in an emailed statement. Foxconn added that &#8220;there has been no workplace stoppage in that facility or any other Foxconn facility and production has continued on schedule&#8221;. Employees who worked over the national holiday did so voluntarily, it added.</p>
<p>Also in the email, Foxconn said it received instructions from Apple to &#8220;strengthen quality inspections&#8221; for the iPhone 5 &#8212; &#8220;following multiple complaints from customers regarding <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/24/657820/">aesthetic flaws</a> in the phone&#8221;.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve asked Apple to confirm this claim and will update with any response.</p>
