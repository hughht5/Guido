But just in case you missed it, a few <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/10/nokia-lumia-822-verizon-leak/">recent leaks</a> have led us to believe that the red carrier will lay claim to the Nokia Lumia 822. And here&#8217;s the real shocker: it should only cost $49, according to <a target="_blank" href="http://wmpoweruser.com/some-more-info-about-the-nokia-lumia-822/">WMPowerUser</a>. </p>
<p>Now, that could sound like only a slight variation from the Lumia 820, headed to AT&amp;T, but the new handset will be quite a bit different. </p>
<p>For one, there will be no interchangeable back covers to match your phone&#8217;s color with your daily mood. And as you can see from the earlier leaked images, the handset itself looks quite a bit different from both the 810 and 820, with much rounder edges. </p>
<p>According to the tipster, both documents are images can be sent via tap2send, Bluetooth, or outlook. </p>
<p>The phone feels a little less premium than the AT&amp;T-flavored Nokia handsets, but it&#8217;ll come with 16GB of internal storage and an LTE connection from Verizon, which is pretty damn good for $49. </p>
