With nearly 1,000 backers already, the FormLabs team has sold out of all their early-bird pledge packages, so anyone who backs the project now is only ahead of the official website sale shipments. </p>
<p>Mad Kickstarter success always comes down to demand. Disrupt runner up <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/22/incidents-gtar-tops-120000-on-kickstarter-thats-110k-in-less-than-24-hours/">gTar walked away</a> with 3x its funding goal because it made learning the guitar fun and easy. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/13/how-the-pebble-smart-watch-hit-2-million-on-kickstarter-qa/">Pebble took home</a> a whopping $10 million after finding the perfect balance between smart watch functionality, beauty, and battery drain. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/27/3d-printer-form-1-gets-6x-its-100k-funding-goal-on-kickstarter-in-one-day/">Form 1</a> is no different. It takes the quality of a $1 million+ professional-grade 3D printing machine and packs it nicely into the price point of a hobbyist&#8217;s play thing. But that wouldn&#8217;t mean anything if it weren&#8217;t for the 10 million+ designers working with CAD software, many of whom have no access to the approximate 30,000 3D printers installed in the world. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s a massive gap, and Form 1 aims to fill it. </p>

<p>I caught up with co-founder Maxim Lobovsky <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/27/3d-printer-form-1-gets-6x-its-100k-funding-goal-on-kickstarter-in-one-day/">(once again)</a> to ask about momentum. He mentioned that most Kickstarter projects sell like hot cakes on the first few days and tend to slow down. Form 1 hit $1 million after 50 hours on Kickstarter, and has raised around 400k in the past four days. Even so, the company will likely sell out before the funding period is over. </p>
<p>Lobovsky tells me that FormLabs is being as realistic as possible with quantity. &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen how a lot of hardware projects on Kickstarter don&#8217;t just ship late, but they ship <em>months</em> late,&#8221; said Lobovsky. </p>
<p>To avoid this, the total amount that FormLabs can raise on the site is around $2.8 million, so that the company is able to ship on time to its loyal backers. </p>
