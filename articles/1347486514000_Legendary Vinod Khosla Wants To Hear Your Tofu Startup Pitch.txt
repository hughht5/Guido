<p>Khosla said one of the companies is trying to develop salt that is &#8220;as salty as salt&#8221; but with 50 percent less sodium to combat high blood pressure and other health problems. He said that people tasted one of the startups&#8217; dairy-less cheese and couldn&#8217;t tell the difference.</p>

<p>The two argued over how far along the taste of faux beef is and how similar it is to regular meat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just never know where these conversations are going to go when I get on stage,&#8221; Arrington said.</p>
<p>Evan Williams and Biz Stone were also on stage earlier today discussing their own meatless meat startup, <a target="_blank" href="http://beyondmeat.com/">Beyond Meat</a>.Â Khosla used his less &#8220;techy&#8221; startup interests to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/vinod-khosla-y-combinator/">discuss larger themes</a>, like his emphasis on the importance of hiring.</p>
<p>*Arrington started the interview by noting how he always sees Khosla described online as legendary, asking how and when that happened.</p>
