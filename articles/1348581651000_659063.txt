We&#8217;ve seen seen the startup offer <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/09/to-bbq-and-beyond-mobile-car-service-uber-moves-to-new-ground-at-sxsw/">BBQ delivery</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/13/today-in-brilliant-marketing-strategies-uber-delivers-ice-cream/">ice cream</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/31/uber-spins-its-latest-variation-on-car-rides-djs-on-party-busses-in-chicago/">buses with DJs</a> and more. Today, Uber is debuting a partnership with real estate listings and search company Trulia to give prospective renters discounted rides.</p>
<p>This weekend, on September 29th and 30th, Trulia and Uber will be hosting a first-of-its-kind promotion, allowing prospective renters who are looking for apartments to receive a 25 percent discount on 3 Uber rides.</p>
<p>The promotion is going to be offered in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington D.C. To redeem the offer, users simply provide their email address on the Uber-Trulia promotional site located <a target="_blank" href="http://agent.trulia.com/acton/fs/blocks/showLandingPage/a/2844/p/p-0058/t/page/fm/0">here</a>, and then receive a unique code to use in the Uber app when contacting a driver.</p>
<p>As Trulia, which recently <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/20/trulia-shares-pop-30-percent-on-first-trade/">debuted as a public company</a> on the New York Stock Exchange, explained to me, many urban professionals who live in big cities don&#8217;t always have a car to get them from point A to point B, so providing a discount on Uber rides makes sense from a partnership standpoint. Plus, the majority of searches and activity from renters are taking place on Trulia&#8217;s mobile apps, so the offer of rides via Uber&#8217;s mobile app is complimentary.</p>
<p>Uber also recently partnered with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/VirginAmerica?sk=app_402478553148370&amp;app_data=dlt-1">Virgin America </a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uber.com/bwe">HBO</a> for promotions.</p>
