I&#8217;ll be there &#8211; just look for the sweating American guy &#8211; as will <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/richardlai">Richard Lai</a> of Engadget who graciously agreed to go as my chaperone. </p>
<p>To RSVP <a target="_blank" href="http://plancast.com/p/cve2">pop over to Plancast</a> or email me at john@techcrunch.com with the subject line “TAIPEI.” If you&#8217;ve already emailed and haven&#8217;t gotten a response, never fear. You and your guests are welcome.</p>
<p>Special thanks to Richard from VIA who helped out planning this little soiree. </p>
<p>I’d love to take your pitches and chat about the entrepreneurial environment in Taipei. Remember: This is an informal, bar-type event and not a formal presentation. Think networking, not seminar.</p>
<p>See you on Tuesday!</p>
