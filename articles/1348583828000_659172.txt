Schiller apparently responded to concerns by pointing out that aluminum is naturally subject to scratches, and that minor chips over time are to be expected with the iPhone 5&#8242;s construction materials.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://9to5mac.com/2012/09/25/apple-marketing-svp-comments-on-iphone-5-scratches-and-chips-that-is-normal-for-aluminum-products/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+9To5Mac-MacAllDay+%289+to+5+Mac+-+Apple+Intelligence%29">9t05Mac received the complete email</a>, and verified the headers to make sure that it was indeed a legitimate email coming from the Apple exec. The body of the email from Schiller reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>Any aluminum product may scratch or chip with use, exposing its natural silver color. That is normal.</p></blockquote>
<p>As we reported yesterday, <a title="#ScratchGate: iPhone 5 Owners Are Discovering Aluminum Is Softer ThanÂ Glass" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/24/657820/">aluminum is relatively soft</a>, especially compared to glass, and will scratch more easily than more durable materials. If you have an iPad or MacBook Air/Pro, you can probably personally attest to aluminum&#8217;s susceptibility to surface scratches. One of the big problems appears to be that Apple has opted to use aluminum with a black surface coating on the darker iPhone 5 model, leading to higher visibility of scratches as the aluminum&#8217;s natural color shows through when it&#8217;s damaged.</p>
<p>The use of aluminum has a pretty considerable upside, however, since drop tests have generally shown that it&#8217;s far more resistant to significant damage from taking tumbles. Dings and dents are one thing, but a shattered back is something that&#8217;s hard to come back from, at least barring expensive repairs. Really, Schiller is just pointing out the obvious, but this is the first comment we&#8217;ve seen about the issue from Apple leadership.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Apple for additional comment and will update if they provide any.</p>
