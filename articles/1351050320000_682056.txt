Thanks to the growth of the web, our pop culture celebrities seem closer to us regular folk than ever &#8212; we can tweet to them, see their personal snapshots on Instagram, access their performances and behind-the-scenes outtakes at any time on YouTube. Now, a brand new startup called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.plaor.com">PLAOR</a> (pronounced player) wants to extend our celebrity interactions to another popular online realm: Online games.</p>
<p>And the company is getting its start with poker, a game where the celebrity angle has been tried-and-true. PLAOR&#8217;s first title that launched this past week is &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.hollywoodpoker.com/">Hollywood Poker</a>,&#8221; and it has lined up a stable of celebrities who will be on deck to play online poker games with regular people, with much of the proceeds going to the charity of each star&#8217;s choice.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a pretty cool concept, so it was great to talk it over a bit with PLAOR&#8217;s founder and CEO <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/mark-caldwell-2">Mark Caldwell</a>, an executive with years of experience <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/mark-caldwell-2">both in entertainment and gaming</a> &#8212; previously he was the VP of engineering for Disney and Playdom. Watch the video embedded above to hear about how this idea came about, why they&#8217;re starting with Hollywood Poker, and PLAOR&#8217;s plans for future star-studded game products.</p>
<p>And to find out more about what exactly is in it for the celebrities, it was great to talk via Skype with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kevinpollakschatshow.com/">Kevin Pollak</a>, an actor and comedian who is one of PLAOR&#8217;s first show business ambassadors. Watch the video embedded below to hear him talk about why Twitter has been a bit of a disappointment for some of its celebrity users (though he is still <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/kevinpollak">on the site</a>), how the growth of the web is impacting the entertainment industry (he&#8217;s been an early adopter to tech compared to many of his peers, with things like his online show <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kevinpollakschatshow.com/">Kevin Pollak&#8217;s Chat Show</a>), why he teamed up with PLAOR, his tips for people who plan on challenging him to poker, and more:</p>
