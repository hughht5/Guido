In typical Apple fashion, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.store.apple.com">the Apple Store</a> has now gone down in advance of today&#8217;s Apple press event (yes &#8220;event,&#8221; not &#8220;press conference&#8221;) here in San Francisco. It&#8217;s <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/apple-iphone-event-rumors-what-will-wont-and-might-be-announced/">expected that Apple will today announce a new, larger-screened iPhone</a> with LTE, which <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/04/apple-iphone-5-rumor-specs/">may or may not be called</a> the &#8220;iPhone 5.&#8221; [Update: <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/whoops-apple-search-engine-is-revealing-product-news-before-todays-event-iphone-5-new-ipods-new-itunes-confirmed/">It totally will be</a>.] Rumors and pundits have been going back and forth on whether  Apple will continue to give iPhone models numbers or go the way of the iPad, simply calling the device &#8220;the new iPhone.&#8221; But <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/04/apple-schedules-special-event-for-september-12/">the Apple press invite</a> seemed to point us more toward the device getting the numerical designation.</p>
<p>Also on the horizon is an update to Apple&#8217;s mobile operating system, iOS 6, which brings hundreds of new features, including an improved Siri, system-wide Facebook integration, specialized call response features that let you automatically answer inbound calls with canned or custom text messages, FaceTime over 3G, Passbook, and more. A new version of iTunes is also expected.</p>
<p>And who knows, maybe even Apple will surprise us today with one more thing: an iPad mini.</p>
