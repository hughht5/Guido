But up until this point, most had to build not just their own apps, but their own backend for hooking into their billing and operating systems and delivering the right content to the right customers. Tvinci seeks to simplify that process with a platform for quickly turning up over-the-top video services without having to build their own platform to do so. </p>
<p>In the midst of its most successful year ever, now Tvinci has brought on new funding to invest more in it platform and to expand the system into new markets. The company raised $4.5 million in funding from existing investors Kaedan Capital and Zohar Gilon, as well as new investor Trellas Enterprises.</p>
<p>Tvinci has built a platform that enables cable and other pay TV operators to quickly deploy over-the-top video services for their subscribers. With more and more consumption of long-form video happening online and on mobile and other connected devices, it&#8217;s become necessary for cable and IPTV companies to build applications for those screens. But rather than having each build their own DIY backend, Tvinci lets them connect with its system and more quickly roll out new services.</p>
<p>Its OTT 2.0 platform takes that a step further by facilitating the creation of mobile and connected TV apps, which its clients &#8212; the big pay TV operators &#8212; can use to deliver video across more screens. Mobile apps built on the Tvinci system don&#8217;t just allow users to browse and consume video, but also can be used to control cable set-top boxes, or can be used as companion devices while someone watches video on the big screen. </p>

<p>Tvinci&#8217;s platform provides flexibility for logging in, so that multiple members of a household can have their own accounts, preferences, and recommendations, rather than having everyone log in with a single account. With individual accounts, it also enables social sharing features, which can be turned on at the discretion of the pay TV operator.</p>
<p>The funding round comes as the company has recently seen pretty dramatic growth: Tvinci&#8217;s revenue has tripled over the past year, and it has doubled headcount to meet demand from clients. It&#8217;s signed up seven TV operators recently, including Liberty Global and Finnish pay TV company Elisa, to help get their content delivered across more screens. </p>
<p>Tvinci was founded in 2007 and has raised about $6 million in total. It now has 50 employees, with offices in London and Tel Aviv, but it&#8217;s expanding into new markets. While it has a strong footprint in Europe, it&#8217;s going to be adding more staff in Asia, after winning a big Tier 1 account there.</p>
