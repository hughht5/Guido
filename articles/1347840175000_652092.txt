The Conservative Party has fallen under scrutiny for being too cozy with Google and their practices this year but this seems to offset that considerably.</p>
<p>Shapps runs <a target="_blank" href="http://www.howtocorp.com">HowToCorp</a>, one of those ubiquitous link farm services that promises to create heady amounts of Google juice for folks who are trying to squat on a topic like, say, &#8220;golf.&#8221;</p>
<p>The service essentially scrapes the web for related content, runs it through a thesaurus, and posts thousands of copies everywhere. The resulting pages, containing lines like &#8220;A free of charge golf swing lesson appears a very little as well superior to be accurate&#8221; are, in theory, supposed to increase your position in Google because, Why? Shit floats.</p>
<p>From the Guardian:</p>
<div style="margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px;padding-left:15px;border-left:3px solid #ccc;font-style:italic;">Going under the name Michael Green and casting himself as an internet marketing guru, Shapps in 2007 claimed audiences could &#8220;make $20,000 in 20 days guaranteed or your money back&#8221; â€“ if they spent $200 buying his bespoke software.Shapps previously told journalists he used the name Michael Green for the business to keep it separate from his political work.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/15/labour-probe-grant-shapps-company">The Labour Party</a> is calling for further investigation. You can read <a target="_blank" href="http://searchengineland.com/uk-conservative-party-chair-founded-google-spamming-business-132087">quite a bit about the scam here</a>, but I find it wonderful that the people are finally getting the tech-savvy politicians they deserve. Who knows? Maybe it could be <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/Horse_ebooks">@horse_ebooks</a> for President in 2016?</p>
