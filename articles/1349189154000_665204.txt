<p>Interestingly, the One X+ won&#8217;t be alone either, as AT&amp;T has also announced that it will sell the lower-end HTC One VX alongside it when they both launch in the &#8220;coming months.&#8221;</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t spend too much time <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/02/htc-finally-reveals-the-refreshed-one-x-and-its-hitting-europe-and-north-asia-this-month/">rehashing the One X+</a> &#8212; aside from its 1.7GHz quad-core Tegra 3 processor and 64GB of internal storage, the Jelly Bean-powered phone is largely the same device that AT&amp;T already launched earlier this year. What&#8217;s arguably more notable here is the addition of a previously-unknown One series handset to AT&amp;T&#8217;s roster.</p>
<p>THe One VX features a 4.5-inch display running at 960&#215;540 (coated in Gorilla Glass, naturally), as well as a 1.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 processor, 1GB of RAM, 5-megapixel camera, NFC, and 8GB of internal storage. The spec sheet may not be a world-changer, but it&#8217;s got a solid chance at selling well if AT&amp;T prices it accordingly. That said, the One VX has two distinct disadvantages when compared to the recently-refreshed One X+ &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t run the same up-to-date version of Android that its bigger brother does (though Ice Cream Sandwich still has plenty of life left in it), and at 9.19mm it&#8217;s a thicker device to boot.</p>
<p>Of course, that didn&#8217;t stop HTC from touting it as one of the &#8220;slimmest unibody form factors&#8221; in the industry &#8212; you&#8217;ve just got to love that spin.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no official word on pricing yet, but<a target="_blank" href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/2/3442764/att-htc-one-x-plus-one-vx"> The Verge</a> has learned that AT&amp;T will continue to sell the original One X at a lower price point rather that discontinue it entirely. Naturally, the two new models will slot in above and below that price point (currently $99), but we&#8217;ll likely have to wait a bit before the official price tags are released.</p>
<p>Oh, and one bit of parting bad news for T-Mobile customers &#8212; AT&amp;T refers to the One X+ as an exclusive in its release, so the dream of a fully fleshed-out HTC One family riding on T-Mo&#8217;s airwaves may remain just that.</p>
