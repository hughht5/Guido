EventO provides event organizers and marketers with responsive HTML5-based micro-sites for their events and can customize these sites to include a variety of services, including registration, tickets, promotion, in-event networking, social integration and photo and video uploads.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that this is a full-service tool, so EventO will set up all of these features for its clients. TBA Global, as the EventO team told me earlier this week, plans to launch a self-service tool in the future. Indeed, EventO is just the first of a number of products the company plans to launch over the course of the next year or so.</p>
<p>Pricing for EventO obviously depends on the kind of event and features a user needs, but the company tells me that pricing will start as low as a few hundred dollars for a basic site and can go up to $200,000 for a large event with all the bells and whistles, including, for example, video production and live streaming on the site.</p>
<p>TBA Global typically works on large events like Google&#8217;s TED-like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tbaglobal.com/work/google-solve-for-x">Solve for X conference</a>, Walmart&#8217;s shareholder meeting or the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tbaglobal.com/work/mcdonalds-live">McDonald&#8217;s Live</a> concert series. As the EventO team told me, the company realized that it was often going through the same processes to get sites for these events up and running and decided to productize the process. While EventO is officially launching today, it is worth noting that TBA Global previously used it to set up sites for its internal clients.</p>
<p>One thing the company learned while setting up these sites for its clients, the team told me, was to ensure that it offered both pre-event tools, as well as mobile sites and apps for attendees at the event. Because of this, the company put a strong emphasis on responsive design for its sites (which, by the way, are based on <a target="_blank" href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a>). Post-event, users can also upload their own videos, photos and other content to keep the conversation going.</p>
<p>Another important aspect of the service is that users are free to use whatever third-party service they want, including, for example, Eventbrite or <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cvent.com/">Cvent</a> for registration and ticketing.</p>
