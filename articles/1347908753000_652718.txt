<p>It&#8217;s not as creepy as it sounds, because your data won&#8217;t be personally identifiable to developers, and you&#8217;ll be able to learn more things about yourself after more brains start building things.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what 23andMe co-founder Anne Wojcicki had to say about the announcement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Opening our API offers an immense opportunity for customers to do more with their DNA. While 23andMe has created a number of groundbreaking and innovative tools for our customers to explore their DNA, the API will open the door to the possibility of new web-based interactive tools to be developed by external groups.</p></blockquote>
<p>Starting today, developers can get themselves familiar with the 23andMe API and start creating; just <a target="_blank" href="https://api.23andme.com">visit this site</a> for details.</p>
<p>Building things on top of a massive social network like Facebook is an exciting proposition, but something like this is just mind-bending. I wouldn&#8217;t have thought that this type of thing could happen if you asked me 10 years ago, and it&#8217;s pretty exciting to see it happen now.</p>
<p>What will developers build on top of our genetic data? We&#8217;ll have to wait and see, but if you&#8217;re working on something, drop me a line at drew@techcrunch.com so that I can take a look.</p>
