The result of the new partnership? The promise of a considerably larger seed investment for its next batch of startups, as Kleiner joined Rock Health&#8217;s existing partners in offering $100K in seed funding to each founding team. </p>
<p>This represents a five-fold increase in funding for Rock Health&#8217;s fourth class, as the startups that launched as part of the accelerator&#8217;s first three classes &#8212; 36 companies in total &#8212; each received $20K. Today, the healthtech accelerator offered the first look at the fourteen startups that will be taking advantage of the additional funding and participating in Rock Health&#8217;s fourth batch.</p>
<p>On top of that, the accelerator is adding another partner to its existing lineup, with Kaiser Permanente today joining its existing partners, which include KPCB, The Mayo Clinic, Mohr Davidow Ventures, Aberdare Ventures, GE, Genentech, United Healthcare, UCSF, Harvard Medical School and Nike. According to Rock Health CEO Halle Tecco, Kaiser will participate as a mentor to its startups, offering advice, strategic consulting as well as the opportunity to test products and models within its network &#8212; with the potential for Kaiser to become a future partner, or even a customer. </p>
<p>Considering Kaiser has one of the largest integrated healthcare systems in the U.S., the partnership is a big win for Rock Health as it continues to build out a support network for its startups. Like other accelerators, Rock Health offers a value-add for its startups by offering mentorship, office space, operational support and seed capital. But the health industry has its own unique set of problems and requirements that are far different from those a startup finds in the consumer space, so to provide real value, healthtech accelerators have to go beyond office space and funding to offer help in these areas.</p>
<p>As we wrote in coverage <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/15/new-accelerator-is-on-a-mission-to-turn-nyc-into-a-hub-for-healthtech-startups/">of New York&#8217;s newest healthtech accelerator</a>, beyond the challenge of getting access to health-focused investors, early-stage digital health startups are hard-pressed to get their products and services in front of their real customers: Doctors, health providers and hospitals.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why adding partners like Kaiser is critical to the success of Rock Health and business incubators like it, providing a venue for startups to test and tweak their products and for those providers to reward them should they succeed in helping them solve their own problems. After all, while there&#8217;s a lot of opportunity for innovation in the health space, legacy vendor architecture, backwards incentive structures, long sales cycles and a system focused not on patient outcomes but expediency provide plenty of bumps in the road for early-stage health businesses.  </p>
<p>As Rock Health has grown and added a larger framework of support, its startups have begun to show more promise as a result. Its fourth batch have more capital to work with, so it will be interesting to see what they&#8217;re able to make out of the added financial &#8212; and partner &#8212; support. </p>
