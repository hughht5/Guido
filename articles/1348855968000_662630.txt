<p>The new front and back shots provide the best look yet at the device-in-progress, and they confirm what many have already claimed — it looks nearly identical to the original One X.</p>
<p>Of course, its largely unchanged appearance is only part of the equation — it was always what was inside that polycarbonate shell that was worth another look. In case you hadn’t been following the One X+ odyssey, the device is said to feature a 1.7GHz quad-core processor (which may or may not be a Tegra 3, depending on who you believe), 1GB of RAM, 64GB of internal storage, and Beats Audio support, and will run Android 4.1 Jelly Bean right out of the gate.</p>
<p>It’s hardly the first time the One X+ has been captured on film — it recently popped up in what appears to be a sales catalog for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.itproportal.com/2012/09/28/htc-one-x-outed-by-o2-as-featuring-android-41-jelly-bean-480-price-tag/">U.K. carrier O2</a>, and the person (or people?) behind the infamous <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks">@evleaks</a> Twitter account posted a sketchy picture of the device complete with a T-Mobile logo. That coupled with the device’s appearance (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.tmonews.com/2012/07/htc-era-blackberry-armstrong-coming-to-t-mobile-in-september/">with a codename</a>, naturally) in another leaked T-Mobile USA document could mean that the carrier’s svelte One S may have soon have some company.</p>
<p>What really gets me here is that HTC very clearly promised last year that it would pare down its smartphone selection in favor for a smaller number of devices in 2012. The company’s been doing a great job of it so far (the One family has been very good to HTC), but I can&#8217;t help but worry that pushing out mildly-updated versions of existing hardware could put HTC back on its original, lousy track. Here&#8217;s hoping HTC can keep that compulsion under control &#8212; the last thing we all need is a rehash of last year&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theverge.com/products/compare/2966/2470/5419">Sensation situation </a>.</p>
