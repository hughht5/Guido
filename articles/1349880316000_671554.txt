But soon, specifically on November 9th, Chicago will play host to a TechCrunch meetup. As the last stop on TechCrunch&#8217;s Northern Meetup Tour, we&#8217;re very excited to conclude with a Friday night party in the Windy City. Admission and booze are free. Come on out to the Zhou B Art Center and talk tech and startups with TechCrunch!</p>
<p>As part of our Northern Meetup Tour, during which we’ll hit up Toronto, Chicago, and of course Detroit, we’re on the hunt for the latest and greatest startups, the coolest investors, and the best possible conversation we can have. Tickets sold out quickly for <a target="_blank" href="http://techcrunchtorontomeetup.eventbrite.com/">Toronto</a> and there are only a few left for <a target="_blank" href="http://techcrunchmeetupdetroit.eventbrite.com/">Detroit</a>. <a target="_blank" href="http://techcrunchchicagomeetup.eventbrite.com/#">RSVP as soon as possible for Chicago</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to the meetup, we are holding office hours with local startups and entrepreneurs. Look for the registration next week.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re still looking for sponsors for this meetup and also upcoming ones in Detroit and Toronto. If you’d like to sponsor one or all of these fantastic gatherings, or know someone that should, shoot a message to our amazing sponsorship team <a target="_blank" href="sponsors@techcrunch.com">here</a>.
