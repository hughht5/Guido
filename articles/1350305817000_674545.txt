Of course, this is to keep pace with holiday demand and maintain an edge in a market that&#8217;s turned more difficult for the gaming company.</p>
<p>The value package includes a black console with Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort on a single disc, along with a black Wii remote and Nunchuk controller. This replaces the current $149 version that includes New Super Mario Bros.</p>
<p>The lower-cost Wii will be available widely starting October 28, at all the same places you&#8217;d normally buy a Wii, like Best Buy, Amazon, Walmart, Gamestop, etc.</p>
<p>As opposed to more hard core consoles, the Wii reaches out to consumers as more of a family toy. With that in mind, it makes sense for Nintendo to go after the holiday shopping crowd.</p>

<p>Nintendo has struggled of late to be the powerhouse it once was. The company&#8217;s finances are on a steady trip downhill, with operating losses of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nintendogal.com/2012/04/27/nintendo-releases-financials-for-fiscal-year-2012/">$462 million as of April</a>.</p>
