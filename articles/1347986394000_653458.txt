High-profile institutions have begun to adopt and launch open courseware initiatives (like EdX and Coursera) and, in so doing, are changing the ways we think about &#8212; and even define &#8212; the learning process. As a result, we&#8217;re seeing less and less value being placed on content as a means of defining and structuring the learning process, with the focus shifting instead to engagement, interactivity, and collaboration.</p>
<p>When we last spoke to BenchPrep CEO Ashish Rangnekar, the vision he laid out for his business was very much influenced by this transformation. At the time, he said that the most effective educational content no longer comes in book or even eBook form, but instead is interactive and cross-platform. The founders, as a result, are on a mission to build BenchPrep into an adaptive learning hub for interactive courses where students define the value of the content as it befits their learning style and study content from any publisher on any device.</p>
<p>The BrenchPrep co-founder tells me that students now think about content ownership in a very different way than they did five years ago &#8212; or even when I was growing up. Students now look at educational content more as a service than as a product.</p>
<p>As a result, the startup is beginning to position itself as an &#8220;Education-as-a-Service&#8221; provider as a reflection of how the learning process is being redefined. To this point, BenchPrep is today dropping its old pricing scheme in favor of a subscription model, throwing out its per-course pricing in which students paid $100 and up for every course they chose to access. Beginning today, BenchPrep is instituting a $30/month subscription rate that provides unlimited access to the startup&#8217;s courses, whether it be from their computers, phones, or tablets.</p>
<p>Beyond eliminating the need to purchase individual courses, the new subscription model reduces the cost of interactive coursework for students, allowing them to navigate between courses to explore new areas or brush up on old ones.</p>
<p>The motivation behind this is fairly transparent. Under the new model, students have the ability to explore a variety of courses without having to pay $100 for each course. Rangnekar tells me that the old pricing kept students from branching out and exploring unrelated topics, sticking instead to the ones they&#8217;d bought, not wanting to shell out $100 every time they saw a course that interested them.</p>
<p>Students can now also set up their own learning programs by combining different types of courses and content across a range of subjects. BenchPrep has forged partnerships with the top-tier publishers, like McGraw Hill, Princeton Review, Wiley, Cengage Learning, and Oâ€™Reilly, and they&#8217;re using this content to build an interactive course library that turns flat education into an interactive learning experience.</p>
<p>With the new subscription strategy, for example, a student taking a college algebra course through BenchPrep can easily go back and take a refresher course on high school algebra without paying for two classes. Similarly, a student who becomes interested in corporate finance while studying for Certified Financial Analyst (CFA) certification can take both courses in parallel at no extra charge. This frictionless navigation across courses would help students create their own personalized learning programs.</p>
