<p>This is a huge development for Twitter, which <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/04/first-2012-presidential-debate-saw-10-3m-tweets-and-gave-politics-a-new-dimension/">as we&#8217;ve pointed out</a> is moving closer and closer to the media industry. Execs at top agencies, firms and networks are all over Twitter to become more involved with the network, we&#8217;ve learned.</p>
<p>Derella comes in to manage the relationships with agencies, which makes complete sense. This is definitely a huge loss for his former employer, Google.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what Derella told AdAge regarding the move:</p>
<blockquote><p>Twitter understands that agencies are going to be a really important part of the Twitter advertising ecosystem, and they understand that we need to invest in our agency partners.</p></blockquote>
<p>As far as what Derella will be doing for Twitter, he says that he&#8217;ll be the interface to agencies who aren&#8217;t sure what Twitter can do for brands and advertising on the network. Yes, there are those out there who don&#8217;t quite &#8220;get it&#8221; yet, and Derella has an uphill battle, but one that is ultimately worth it in my opinion.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a certain amount of squashing of rumors and mis-truths about the quality of Twitter ads themselves, which the company needs to do a better job of explaining to the masses who have the advertising dollars to spend.</p>
