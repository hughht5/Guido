<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/apple-samsunggraphic.jpeg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="apple-samsunggraphic" title="apple-samsunggraphic" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Samsung has been widely expected to add the iPhone 5 to its ongoing patent disputes with Apple, and today the Korean electronics company made that official, noting in a U.S. court filing <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/20/us-samsung-apple-idUSBRE88J0H520120920">uncovered by Reuters</a> that it &#8220;will file, in the near future, a motion to amend its infringement contentions to add the iPhone 5 as an accused product.&#8221; Samsung expects the iPhone 5 to fall under the same areas of infringement as existing iPhone models.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not surprising that Samsung would target the iPhone 5, given that the device has already been a high-profile hit for its smartphone market leadership rival. The <a title="Apple Announces Record Pre-Orders For iPhone 5: 2M in 24 Hours, 2X iPhone 4S Day One Sales" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/17/apple-announces-record-pre-orders-for-iphone-5-2m-in-24-hours/">iPhone 5 sold 2 million units in its first 24 hours</a> of pre-order availability, and is on pace to set records again for opening weekend sales, according to <a title="Analyst Estimates On iPhone 5 Launch Weekend Sales Range From 3M-10M" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/18/analyst-estimates-on-iphone-5-launch-weekend-sales-range-from-3m-10m/">most early estimates</a>. Samsung&#8217;s primary goal in its legal wrangling with Apple appears to be to counter that company&#8217;s aggressive stance with regards to patent litigation, as indicated by another statement received by Reuters from the Korean company.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple continues to take aggressive legal measures that will limit market competition,&#8221; the statement reads. &#8220;Under these circumstances, we have little choice but to take the steps necessary to protect our innovations and intellectual property rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a brief recap of the latest blows exchanged by these two in their ongoing legal battle, remember that Apple was awarded over<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/24/apple-wins-patent-ruling-as-jury-finds-samsung-infringes/"> $1 billion in damages by a U.S. court in August</a>, Samsung&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/09/judge-cant-lift-ban-on-samsung-tablet-even-though-its-not-infringing/">Galaxy Tab 10.1 remains barred for sale in the U.S.</a>, Samsung and Apple saw a <a target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444812704577608242792921450.html">split decision in a South Korean court</a>, and Samsung <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/01/technology/in-japan-a-setback-for-apples-patent-fight.html?_r=0">nabbed a win in Japan</a> over the bounce-back visual interface effect used on smartphones and tablets. Samsung throwing the iPhone 5 onto the pile is just another sign that we&#8217;re very far from seeing the end of this back-and-forth. It&#8217;ll be interesting to see if in addition to existing actions, any new ones arise from the iPhone 5 (perhaps <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/10/is-the-next-iphone-in-already-in-patent-trouble/">over LTE use in smartphone devices</a>) after its official arrival on Friday.</p>
<p>We reached out to Apple for comment, and will update if we hear back.</p>
