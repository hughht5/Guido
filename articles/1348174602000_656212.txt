Along with their <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/19/ios-6-review-the-highs-the-lows-and-everything-in-between/">iOS 6</a> update, many amateur digital cartophiles were in for a rude awakening: Apple Maps, which <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/11/with-flyover-3d-rendering-and-yelp-and-siri-integration-apple-maps-makes-google-maps-look-like-childs-play/">looked so cool</a> in Apple&#8217;s launch demo, are actually, and hilariously, a POS (Yes, I was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/11/with-flyover-3d-rendering-and-yelp-and-siri-integration-apple-maps-makes-google-maps-look-like-childs-play/">wrong</a>).</p>
<p>And, in releasing what is essentially a half-baked beta of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/11/with-flyover-3d-rendering-and-yelp-and-siri-integration-apple-maps-makes-google-maps-look-like-childs-play/">this </a>in its rush to be free of Google, Apple has also released a torrent of user <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/19/if-i-were-google-i-wouldnt-release-a-native-ios-6-maps-app-for-six-months/">criticism</a>.</p>
<p>Digital maps are are obviously a difficult endeavor, and the data from OSM and Tom Tom leaves much to be desired here. But the failure is so glaring that even some Apple peeps are wondering when Google will release its standalone iOS Maps app, because using Google Maps on Safari is just sort of awkward. HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO NAVIGATE THE EARTH? Help us Google iOS Maps team, you are our only hope.</p>
<p>Debunking the diabolical theory that Google will take as long as it likes to release its Maps App, in an effort to convert people to Android, I&#8217;ve got a source telling me that the Google Maps team is taking this as a crisetunity, doubling down on staff, lining up the team and resources to have a standalone iOS app in the App store &#8220;before Christmas.&#8221; 9to5Mac is reporting that Google already has an i<a target="_blank" href="http://9to5mac.com/2012/09/20/google-has-an-ios-6-maps-app-awaiting-approval-it-is-solely-up-to-apple-to-approve/">OS 6-ready app</a>, and it&#8217;s waiting for Apple&#8217;s review.</p>
<p>If either rumor is true, this is chivalrous behavior on Google&#8217;s part. Perhaps they realize that users won&#8217;t make the Android switch just for Maps, and are trying to have their bases covered on the Maps asset? This is what their PR <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/19/if-i-were-google-i-wouldnt-release-a-native-ios-6-maps-app-for-six-months/">told</a> Drew.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We believe Google Maps are the most comprehensive, accurate and easy-to-use maps in the world. Our goal is to make Google Maps available to everyone who wants to use it, regardless of device, browser, or operating system.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>We&#8217;re trying to get an updated statement and more sources.</p>
<p>In the meantime, LOL.</p>
