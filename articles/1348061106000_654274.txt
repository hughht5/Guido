Well, you probably haven&#8217;t heard of its newest investor &#8212; at least, not unless you pay close attention to Eastern European petrochemical industry. But that investor is throwing a lot of money at the company&#8230; $20 million worth.</p>
<p>Mobli is announcing today that it has raised $22 million in new funding, including $20 million from <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenges_Rakishev">Kazakhstan businessman and investor Kenges Rakishev</a>. The other $2 million came from Mobli&#8217;s existing investors, which is made up by an all-star group of Hollywood celebs and superstar athletes such as <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/10/mobli-sxsw/">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>, Tobey Maguire, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/30/after-leo-dicaprio-lance-armstrong-races-to-promote-advise-mobli/">Lance Armstrong</a>, and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/26/serena-williams-invests-in-mobli-will-use-it-to-snap-picsvideo-at-olympics/">Serena Williams</a>. Mobli has raised a total of $28 million to date.</p>
<p>Rakishev has made a couple of other significant investments lately, including <a target="_blank" href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120501006114/en/Noted-Kazakhstan-Business-Leader-Kenges-Rakishev-Acquires">investing $32 million in Internet and mobile publisher Net Element</a>, and another <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/22/triplay-rakes-in-15m-and-a-new-oligarch-investor-to-take-its-consumer-cloud-to-europe-asia/">$5 million into cloud media services provider TriPlay</a>. In both cases, Rakishev was expected to bring those technologies into Eastern Europe, and with both investments he gained a board seat. He will, not surprisingly, also be getting a seat on Mobli&#8217;s board.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s the thing: Mobli, while taking a lot of money, is aligning itself with kind of an unknown entity in Rakishev. And that&#8217;s after taking its previous investments not from institutional investors, but from celebs that it hopes strategically will help it capture more consumer interest. Mobli SVP Gil Eyal acknowledged in a phone conversation that the company has &#8220;taken an untraditional path as far as fundraising is concerned.&#8221; </p>
<p>But will it work? Serena and Lance have been making original content &#8212; but in most successful startups, the celeb endorsement usually comes after they&#8217;ve successfully aggregated a large enough audience. You know, so celebs have someone to connect with, instead of bringing the audience to the startup.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, Mobli isn&#8217;t necessarily trying to be the Instagram for video. In fact, most of its volume comes from photos. Eyal says it&#8217;s getting hundreds of photos uploaded for every video. So is there room for another Instagram clone? Unlike some of the other photo-sharing companies out there, Mobli hopes to be the place where content creators feel more comfortable telling stories with their content. Whatever that means.</p>
<p>But who knows? This is the company that&#8217;s putting its trust in investors who are better known for their sports prowess or film starpower than, you know, building a sustainable business. And some Kazakhstan dude who just started putting money in some random companies. I guess the good news is that, you know, they&#8217;ve got plenty of money to burn.</p>
