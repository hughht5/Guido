The over-the-air nature of the update no doubt helped with that rate of adoption. Chitika also notes that the rate is much higher than Google experienced with its Jelly Bean update, which was on only 1.5% of devices after two full months.</p>
<p>The quick adoption curve was a likely outcome, given that Apple experienced <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/20/apples-ios-6-causes-massive-traffic-spike-signals-high-early-adoption-despite-maps-issues/" title="Apple’s iOS 6 Causes Massive Traffic Spike, Signals High Early Adoption Despite Maps Issues">massive increases in web traffic</a> alongside the release. Another comparison point: iOS 5 took around <a target="_blank" href="http://insights.chitika.com/2011/ios5-breaks-into-the-market-with-record-numbers/">five days to account for just over 20 percent of overall iOS traffic</a> on Chitika&#8217;s network.</p>
<p>While updates pushed OTA likely accounted for the speedier uptake of iOS 6 vs. iOS 5, it probably isn&#8217;t the only factor. <a target="_blank" href="http://insights.chitika.com/2012/report-ios-5-1-1-on-more-than-12-of-ios-devices-after-first-week/">iOS 5.1.1 had an adoption rate of 12 percent</a> according to Chitika, which means users were likely more interested in the host of new features that iOS 6 offers, where 5.1.1 was generally designed to patch security flaws.</p>
