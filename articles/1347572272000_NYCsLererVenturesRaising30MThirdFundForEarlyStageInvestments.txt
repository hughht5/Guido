It&#8217;s the third fund in the venture firm&#8217;s history and raises the  bar from Lerer&#8217;s second, $25 million fund, which it raised in May 2011. (Its maiden fund was worth $8 million and was raised in early 2010.)</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar, Lerer Ventures is an NYC-based firm that invests in early-stage startups and companies, most often as part of seed and series A investments. The firm was founded by Ken Lerer, the chairman and co-founder of The Huffington Post (as well as a chairman of <a target="_blank" href="http://betaworks.com/about.php">betaworks</a> and Buzzfeed). His son, Ben Lerer, perhaps better known as a co-founder of Thrillist, is also a partner at the venture firm, along with former Huffington Post CEO and Softbank partner, Eric Hippeau.</p>
