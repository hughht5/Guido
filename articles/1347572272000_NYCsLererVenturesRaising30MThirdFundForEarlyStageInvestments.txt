It&#8217;s the third fund in the venture firm&#8217;s history and aims to raise the bar a bit from Lerer&#8217;s <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/23/lerer-ventures-raises-second-25m-seed-fund-for-nyc-startups/">second, $25 million fund</a>, which it raised in May 2011. (Its maiden fund was worth $8 million and was raised in early 2010.)</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar, Lerer Ventures is an NYC-based firm that invests in early-stage startups and companies, most often as part of seed and series A investments. The firm was founded by Ken Lerer, the former chairman and co-founder of The Huffington Post and current chairman of <a target="_blank" href="http://betaworks.com/about.php">betaworks</a> and Buzzfeed. </p>
<p>His son, Ben Lerer, perhaps better known as a co-founder of Thrillist, is also a partner at the venture firm, along with former Huffington Post CEO and Softbank partner, Eric Hippeau. (With Jonah Peretti advising, it may seem somewhat surprising the firm isn&#8217;t named HuffPo Ventures.) </p>
<p>The firm has made some 85 investments to date, the majority of which have been in NYC-based (and media-focused) startups. Lerer portfolio companies include, to name a few: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/appsfire">Appsfire</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/adapt-ly">Adaptly</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/tag/backplane/">Backplane</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/birchbox">Birchbox</a>, Chartbeat, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/15/classdojo-launch-seed-funding/">ClassDojo</a>, IFTTT, Newsle, Pando, Pulse, Qwiki, Ridejoy, Simple, Venmo and Warby Parker.</p>
<p>Portfolio companies that have recently exited include GroupMe (acquired by Skype for $41 million), Hipster (acquired by Aol) and DailyBooth (talent acquisition by Airbnb).</p>
