It will feature a 11.6-inch screen capable of running 1080p video, weigh 2.5 pounds, be 0.8 inches thick, and run for more than 6.5 hours on battery.</p>
<p>Sundar Pichai, Google&#8217;s senior vice president for Chrome and Apps, said the goal was to create a Chromebook that was affordable and could stand up favorably to laptops in a similar price range. He said the team sees this as a second device people use at home as a complement to their desktop computer or a more powerful laptop.</p>
<p>Pichai argued that when consumers make purchasing decisions, they think in terms of &#8220;ecosystems&#8221; (though they probably wouldn&#8217;t use that word) — if you use a lot of Microsoft services, you&#8217;ll probably buy a Windows device, whereas a Chromebook should be more appealing if you use lots of Google services and devices. In particular, he said that Google is emphasizing Google Drive as the best way to store files and make them available across devices, and the new Chromebooks will come with 100 gigabytes of free Drive storage for two years. (The device also comes with 16 gigabytes of flash memory.)</p>
<p>It sounds like Google is trying to reach a mainstream audience with the new devices — in fact, Pichai said the company is launching <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/18/chromebooks-for-everyone/">its first big Chromebook ad campaign tonight</a>.</p>
