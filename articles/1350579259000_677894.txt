It will feature a 11.6-inch screen, weigh 2.5 pounds, be 0.8 inches thick, and run for more than 6.5 hours on battery.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be updating this post with more details from the press conference, but in the meantime, you can also check out <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/">the new Chromebook product site</a>.</p>
