<p>At Google, De Castro was VP of its worldwide Partner Business Solutions group, responsible for advertising platforms and services for Mountain View&#8217;s publisher and commerce partners. Prior to that, he led Google&#8217;s media, mobile and platforms organization. He has also worked for Dell, where he managed sales and business development operations across Western Europe, and consulted for McKinsey &amp; Company, where he advised numerous clients across many different industries. His career also includes senior positions in private equity and advertising businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Henrique is an incredibly accomplished and rigorous business leader, and I&#8217;m personally excited to have him join Yahoo&#8217;s strong leadership team,&#8221; said Mayer in a statement. &#8220;His operational experience in Internet advertising and his proven success in structuring and scaling global organizations make him the perfect fit for Yahoo as we propel the business to its next phase of growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commenting on his new role, de Castro added in a statement: &#8221;The combination of Yahoo&#8217;s unique properties with high quality content, its renewed focus on outstanding user experience and its massive reach bring tremendous value to users, advertisers and partners. This is a pivotal point in Yahoo&#8217;s history, and I believe strongly in the opportunity ahead. I can&#8217;t wait to join Marissa and the team and get started.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yahoo said De Castro will join the company on or before January 22, 2013 &#8212; or as soon as he has satisfied his obligations to his current employer.</p>
<p>Late last month Yahoo also named a new chief financial officer, Ken Goldman, who joined from Fortinet, a provider of threat management technologies.</p>
