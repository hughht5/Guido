<p>The handsomest man in the world, Bre Pettis, gives the second handsomest man in the world, Phil Torrone, a nice visit to the Makerbot Store in Manhattan. The store is now selling Makerbots, filament, as well as pre-made items like watches and toys.</p>
<p>The store is at <a target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com.tw/maps?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=safari&amp;q=298+Mulberry+Street+new+york&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x89c2598f87872553:0x7430f8a8d5e024fe,298+Mulberry+St,+New+York,+NY+10012,+USA&amp;gl=tw&amp;ei=Ba9ZUMz6EKnemAWemIDICw&amp;ved=0CB4Q8gEwAA">298 Mulberry Street.</a></p>
<p>As Bre notes, they built the store to convince people that 3D printers weren&#8217;t all science fiction. We <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/19/makerbot-releases-the-2199-replicator-2-0-a-leap-forward-in-home-3d-printing/">visited with the new Replicator</a>, the $2,199 version 2.0, and came away wildly impressed at the fit and finish of the new model. The store, it seems, is just as cool.</p>
<p>As a proud (and jealous) owner of the first Replicator, I&#8217;m really glad to see this thing inch closer to what can only be termed a 3D printing singularity. Once we all have these, the network effects and improvement of general 3D printing techniques will change the way we think about physical objects. Until then, I&#8217;m going to keep printing me some <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:30971">proud roosters</a>.</p>
