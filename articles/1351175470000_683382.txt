Pocket&#8217;s rebrand was all about going beyond just being an article-saving tool and becoming a catch-all scrapbook for anyone&#8217;s digital life, and the new Mac app is a good complement to that mission.</p>
<p>The Mac app is relatively minimal by design, with a list of your saved content from the service on the left, and a viewer for articles, media and websites on the right. Controls along the top let you sort your saved stuff by content type (articles, videos or images); archive, delete, and share items; switch between simple and full web views, and also adjust font settings for articles. Search your saved content via a search bar at the bottom left, and browse by user-assigned tags, too.</p>
<p>Pocket for Mac also does a great job of letting you save content, via the Command-S keyboard shortcut that automatically adds whatever you&#8217;ve got stored on your OS X clipboard to your account. It&#8217;s easier to use the browser bookmark if you&#8217;re actually on the web, but if you see a tweet with a link you&#8217;re interested in checking out later, just right-click and copy and then save it directly to Mac to avoid getting distracted from whatever you&#8217;re currently concentrating on.</p>
<p>The Pocket for Mac app is free, easy and pleasant to use, and does a lot of what most users need out of Evernote without the clutter of added features intended for power users. A lot of what I save on my iPhone is stuff that I know I&#8217;ll need when I&#8217;m working on my Mac, so this is the perfect tool for that kind of usage. If you&#8217;re an existing Pocket user, this is a great addition, and if you&#8217;re new, this might also be a good place to start with the service.</p>
