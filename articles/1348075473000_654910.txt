<p>The talk began with a video that featured a woman who tells her car she wants to go to work. It showed a man using an immersive environment and gestures to command a network of automated operations.</p>
<p>Benioff can&#8217;t go too far. He showed how the office changes with the use of social technologies. But he used that as a springboard to discuss how companies such as General Electric are thinking most about how to connect machines and people into a social network.</p>

<p>Machines are getting their own social networks. They are connecting. They are making friends. They are liking each other when a machine in their network shares an issue.</p>
<p>VMware showed at VMworld how Socialcast activity streams can be used to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/01/how-machines-will-use-social-networks-to-gain-identity-develop-relationships-and-make-friends/">connect hosts and virtual machines in a data center</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the switch we are seeing. We are starting to see how society will some day interact more with software than people. Everything will be a node. That future is emerging now as we see how the cloud is being used to direct machines. Like the self-driving car Benioff featured in his keynote this morning.</p>
