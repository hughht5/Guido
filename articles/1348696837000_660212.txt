But like most things, appearances don&#8217;t always tell the whole story.</p>
<p>The Zipp, it turns out, is different than anything else available for a number of reasons. Sure, it has an interchangeable collection of Italian wool sweaters and a unique 360-degree array of ribbon-based tweeters, but how you connect to the speaker is the most interesting part about it. Not only is the Zipp AirPlay-compatible, but you can connect your iOS device or computer (Mac, PC) to it via a direct Wi-Fi connection &#8212; not over your existing Wi-Fi network. That direct connection is unique to the Zipp and allows for more data to be transferred, Soren Pedersen, chairman and CEO of Libratone told me.</p>
<p>Setting up your device to the Zipp is simple and quick and no different from connecting to any other Wi-Fi network. You can also jack in any device via the 3.5mm port located in the back. There wasn&#8217;t any noticeable lag when streaming music through the iPhone&#8217;s music app but there was noticeable lag when changing tracks through MOG&#8217;s app. Sound quality appeared to be quite good, but for the sake of others in the office, we didn&#8217;t crank the volume up very high. (We&#8217;ll have a review sometime next month.)</p>

<p>Another notable feature of the Zipp is the ability to adjust and optimize sound quality based on the speaker&#8217;s location (distance off the ground, from a wall, etc.) through the company&#8217;s existing <a target="_blank" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/libratone/id461374277?mt=8">iOS app</a>. It&#8217;s a feature that&#8217;s been available for the other speakers in the lineup but new to me.</p>
<p>Pedersen also told me that it took the company quite some time to find the right material that wouldn&#8217;t hinder audio quality, and that they ultimately settled on the wool from a purveyor in Florence.</p>

<p>The Zipp will be available starting next month at all Apple Stores in an array of colors starting at $399. Exclusive to Apple will be red- (non-Product Red related) and grey-only versions for $399. There will also be two three-pack versions to choose from, as well. The &#8220;Classic Color Collection&#8221; includes a black, blue and red wool zip-up, while the &#8220;Funky Color Collection&#8221; includes black, pink and yellow. Both kits will sell for $449. All colors will be available <em>a la carte</em> for $50 a pop.</p>
