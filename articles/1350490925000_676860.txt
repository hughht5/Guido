By announcing these new APIs on its <a target="_blank" href="http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/">enterprise blog</a> and by asking developers to go through its sales team to purchase access, the company is clearly signaling that these features aren&#8217;t so much meant for casual apps, though it&#8217;s easy to see how many location-aware apps could profit from using these tools.</p>
<p>The new <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/business/tracks/">Google Maps Tracks API</a> will allow developers to build apps that can store, display and analyze GPS data on a map. This API, says Google, will allow organizations &#8220;to develop customized location-based applications to meet specific business needs.&#8221; The API will also allow developers access to features like geofencing.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/17/google-apis-for-location-tracking-gps-free-geolocation/tracks-api/" rel="attachment wp-att-676893"></a>The <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/business/geolocation/">Google Maps Geolocation API</a> allows developers to get more accurate location data without the need to use a GPS. Instead, the service tries to triangulate your location by looking at the cell towers and WiFi access points around you. This, of course, sounds quite a bit like the functionality that third-party services like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.skyhookwireless.com/">Skyhook</a> have been offering for quite a while now. According to Google, this service is meant to save battery life and to allow for better indoor location (where GPS can&#8217;t work).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Google also offers <a target="_blank" href="http://coordinate.google.com/">Maps Coordinate</a>, a full-blown tracking service for businesses that offers many of the same features (tracking, location sharing, etc.) these new APIs now enable for third-party apps. Maps Coordinate also offers <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/coordinate/">its own API</a>.</p>
