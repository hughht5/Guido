The company is backed by $700,000 in seed funding, having recently closed a seed investment round of $600,000 led by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/floodgate">Floodgate</a>. The round also saw participation from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/sv-angel">SV Angel</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/sean-jacobsohn-2">Sean Jacobsohn</a>, a partner at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/emergence-capital-partners">Emergence Capital</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/harris-barton">Harris Barton</a>, the SF 49ers football star-turned-investor. TechCrunch co-founder Keith Teare&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/archimedes-ventures">Archimedes Labs</a> is also an investor in M.dot.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/18/backed-by-floodgate-sv-angel-others-m-dot-launches-ios-app-for-building-mobile-websites-from-your-iphone/mdot-website-3/" rel="attachment wp-att-678279"></a>Based in Redwood City, and now a team of five, the company thinks of itself as more than just another mobile website creation service. Explains Dominik Balogh, who co-founded M.dot with Serbajlo Pavel, &#8220;M.dot is a first step in the segment towards helping small businesses be truly mobile, and manage their mobile presence from an actual mobile device wherever they are.&#8221; Mobile website creation is just the beginning and the core of M.dot, he says.</p>
<p>Currently, the service allows business owners to use an iOS app to create their mobile site, choosing from a gallery of included templates to do so. Users can turn on or off the features they need &#8211; like photo galleries, a blog, an &#8220;About&#8221; page and more. They can also tap to add new pages on the fly, and the interface makes it really simple to add key items like Store Hours, a logo, or social sharing buttons, for example. Everything about the app has been designed with a mobile-first mindset, and is optimized for a small screen.</p>

Balogh insists it is. He says the company won&#8217;t have to deal with legacy complications or compatibility issues, which offers them a technological advantage over the competition. Plus, many small business owners may just feel more comfortable using an app than an online service.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a real need for this kind of product. A number companies have sprung up to address the lack of mobile websites for SMBs with &#8220;mobilizer&#8221; offerings, already. For example, leading service DudaMobile partnered with GoDaddy and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/05/googles-gomo-expands-adds-diy-mobile-website-building-tools/">Google, where it&#8217;s white-labeled as Google GoMo</a>. But Balogh says these types of services are not really M.dot&#8217;s competition. &#8220;Our approach is not applying a mobile CSS and JavaScript to an already existing website,&#8221; he states. &#8220;M.dot is a standalone service where the owner doesn&#8217;t even have to own any website yet.&#8221; However, if the business owner <em>does</em> have a website, M.dot can scrape the photos and text and let the user fill in a predefined mobile template and host it on the m. subdomain.</p>
<p>As for what&#8217;s next, the startup will work on mobile promotion and third-party service integrations, creating distribution channels, and building apps for Android, iPad and possibly the web. For now, M.dot is free. Plans for monetization in the future will involve paying a yearly subscription for a package which includes a site on the M.dot domain and promotion on third-party services. However, details and pricing info regarding those plans are not available right now. You can download the M.dot app for free <a target="_blank" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/m.dot/id565017826?ls=1&amp;mt=8">here in iTunes</a>.</p>
