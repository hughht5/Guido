The program allows third party companies to tap into Zynga&#8217;s network, while helping Zynga beef up its mobile gaming ecosystem as it seeks to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/05/more-competitors-smarter-gamers-expensive-ads-less-virality-mobile/">grow its non-Facebook business</a>. Back in June, Zynga reported having <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/26/zynga-reaches-22-million-daily-active-users-on-mobile-announces-partners-program/">22 million daily active users on mobile</a> (vs 53 million daily active users on Facebook).</p>
<p>The game is a reworking of Atari&#8217;s Breakout arcade classic. Players play as a character called Rodney the bunny who&#8217;s on a quest to rescue various cute creatures from cages at the nefarious Evil Animal Testing (E.A.T. &#8212; see what they did there?) Labs. The Breakout aspect of the gameplay involves using Rodney as the ball (it&#8217;s ok, he&#8217;s got a crash-helmet on&#8230;) to bounce around breaking bricks to free the other animals. Additional playable characters can be unlocked, and there are 40+ levels to bounce through.</p>
<p>The iOS app &#8212; which works on iPhone, iPod touch and iPad &#8212; costs $0.99, with optional in-app extras to buy. An Android version of the app is listed as &#8220;coming soon&#8221;.</p>
<p>Atari was one of a handful of initial partners of Zynga&#8217;s Mobile Partner Program, along with Phosphor Games and Crash Lab. The Atari brand is familiar to anyone who <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/28/atari-is-40-years-old-and-i-still-cant-beat-the-dragon-in-adventure/">grew up in the 70s</a> as a maker of arcade games, games consoles and home computers. Atari has long since stopped making hardware; the current leadership team is focused on <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/30/missile-command-in-html5-atari-teams-up-with-microsoft-to-bring-8-classic-games-to-the-browser/">leveraging IP</a> and brand cachet &#8212; and pushing its software development efforts <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/29/atari-looks-to-reinvent-itself-as-a-mobile-games-company-hires-former-iwonmarvel-exec-as-evp/">into mobile and social gaming</a>, hence the Zynga tie-up.</p>
