But Samsung and Android are getting in the mix too, as the blue carrier has just announced that the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/29/samsung-announces-the-galaxy-camera-4-8-display-quad-core-exynos-soc-and-jelly-bean/">Samsung Galaxy Camera</a> will be available from AT&amp;T. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, a due date on this one is missing from the release. </p>
<p>The Galaxy Camera was announced in August back <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/29/samsung-announces-the-galaxy-camera-4-8-display-quad-core-exynos-soc-and-jelly-bean/">at the IFA conference</a> in Berlin, Germany. At it&#8217;s core, the gizmo is essentially an Android-powered digital camera, with WiFi, AT&amp;T 4G LTE, and a quad-core SoC.</p>
<p>Perhaps more exciting, the Galaxy Camera ships with <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/27/android-jelly-bean-official/">Android 4.1 Jelly Bean</a>, which has yet to really see the light of day on a smartphone save for a few of the Nexus handsets. In terms of imaging specs, you&#8217;re working with a 21x optical zoom lens paired with a 16MP BSI CMOS sensor. </p>
<p>On the other side, you&#8217;ll find a 4.8-inch 720p SLCD display. </p>
<p>Past that, you&#8217;ll also be tapping into some of the Galaxy S III&#8217;s headline features like All Share Play, Share Shot, and Buddy Photo Share. </p>
