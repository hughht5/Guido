<p>The list of tweaks and updates is an extensive one, but perhaps the most notable change here is the 4-inch display, bringing the device in line with the new, larger iPhone. As you would expect, there’s a new (but sort of old) processor in the mix as well — Apple’s A5 chipset replaces the aging A4 seen in its most immediate predecessor, and it brings it with some nifty features that hadn’t yet made their way to the Wi-Fi-only devices. </p>
<p>Apple has been very thoughtful about driving the down the size and weight of its newer devices, and the 5th gen iPod Touch is no exception. At, 6.1mm thick and weighing in at a scant 88g, Apple&#8217;s Greg Joswiak pegs it as being the company&#8217;s thinnest and lightest yet. That&#8217;s quite an achievement, especially considering just how insubstantial the prior generation was in terms of feel.</p>
