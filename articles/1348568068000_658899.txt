Recent examples include <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/11/medstartr-launch/">MedStartr</a>, crowdfunding for healthcare startups; <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/20/ipo-vc-angel-fundersclub/">FundersClub</a> which actually gives you equity for your startup investments (not just a set of stickers); and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/03/appsplit-is-crowdfunding-for-apps/">Appsplit</a>, a crowdfunding for apps. You get the picture. Anyway, the latest crowdsourcing platform to join the fray is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gambitious.com/">Gambitious</a> &#8212; and the particular crowdfunding furrow it&#8217;s aiming to plough is video games.</p>
<p>Gambitious claims to be the first crowdfunding platform exclusively dedicated to the games industry. The funding model it&#8217;s introducing is a hybrid one &#8212; which means games developers can ask for either fan pledges/donations and/or, in the European Union, request equity investments. Gambitious says it anticipates being able to open up equity investments to the U.S. next year &#8212; following the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/05/with-jobs-act-becoming-law-crowdfunding-platforms-look-to-create-self-regulatory-body/">passing into law of the JOBS Act</a>.</p>
<p>The company requires developers to submit a detailed business and marketing plan to qualify for inclusion on Gambitious (developers still retain their IP). Then, if the game reaches its investment goal and turns a profit, any equity investors will receive dividends based on their initial investments.</p>
<p>&#8220;Crowdfunding is causing a great seismic shift in how projects get funded, however, there are risks of crash-and-burn due to unfulfilled projects and unfinished games,&#8221; said Gambitious CEO Paul Hanraets in a statement. &#8220;Unlike other crowdfunding platforms, Gambitious is designed specifically for the video game industry and ups the ante of developer credibility, investor engagement and development cycle understanding.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is time to move from the wild, wild, west of crowdfunding to a more professional model,&#8221; added Gambitious Co-Founder Mike Wilson in a statement. &#8221;Crowdfunding is the best thing to happen to indies since shareware in the 90&#8242;s and Gambitious is a transformational way of funding the video game market &#8212; legitimizing, protecting, and maximizing the opportunity for all that want a stake in the game.&#8221;</p>
<p>The platform has launched with seven new projects asking for funds &#8212; from a mix of indie developers and veteran game designers. The seven are:</p>
