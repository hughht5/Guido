Live and in real-time.</p>
<p>Using a public Google Document, Hartmann is typing away on &#8220;The Dragon Lords&#8221;, and the whole idea absolutely fascinates me. It&#8217;s unlikely that I&#8217;ll sit at my computer and watch her type, but I&#8217;ll probably check in from time to time on how she&#8217;s doing.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what the Google Enterprise team <a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/112893701314508522131/posts/iQ6STVxWok2">had to say about it</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fantasy author Silvia Hartmann is reinventing the editorial process by letting her readers follow along as she drafts her new novel – The Dragon Lords – in a public Google document. Hartmann started writing last week, and has already drafted 20 chapters.</p>
<p>Read the story so far and follow along to find out how it ends: <a target="_blank" href="http://goo.gl/Bb6bF">http://goo.gl/Bb6bF</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Of course you can&#8217;t do your own editing with the document, but it is quite an experience to feel such a bond with an author. I have never read Hartmann&#8217;s work, but this is something that definitely got my attention.</p>
<p>You might get a chance to read the book before it&#8217;s ever available for purchase. It&#8217;s like being in a recording studio with your favorite band.</p>
