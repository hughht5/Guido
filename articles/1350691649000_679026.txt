But it didn&#8217;t actually increase longer-term marketshare for any of them &#8212; except for one.</p>
<p>Waze boosted its market share to 10 percent of U.S. iPhone users from 7 percent, according to a study from <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/24/onavos-data-compressing-mobile-app-raises-10-million-series-b-from-horizons-motorola-ventures/">Sequoia Capital-backed mobile data compression</a> company <a target="_blank" href="http://www.onavo.com/apps/iphone">Onavo</a>. You may not have heard of Onavo, but <a target="_blank" href="http://www.onavo.com/apps/iphone">they have a data compression app</a> that helps users shut down wasteful apps and make the most out of their limited data plans. The way they&#8217;ve designed the app means that they have visibility into the real-time usage of hundreds of thousands of apps. Unlike analytics companies which count thousands of developers as their clients, they aren&#8217;t bound from disclosing trends in individual app usage.</p>
<p>Onavo used a sample set of 100,000 U.S. iPhone users to look at map app usage following the release of Apple Maps in iOS6. Many apps including Microsoft&#8217;s Bing, MapQuest and Waze saw a 60 percent increase in daily active usage after <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/28/tim-cook-apologizes-for-apple-maps-points-to-competitive-alternatives/">Apple CEO Tim Cook apologized for glitches</a> in the company&#8217;s new app.</p>
<p>Despite this uptick, the marketshare of these apps is so small that only one app saw a game-changing increase in marketshare. That was Waze, the crowd-sourced mapping app that helps users see traffic in real-time. Waze says it&#8217;s not sharing any new data on their usage, according to spokesperson Michal Habdank-Kolaczkowski.</p>
<p>Waze, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/18/waze-secures-30m-in-funding-hits-7-million-users/">which has raised at least $67 million in venture funding</a> from firms including BlueRun Ventures, Kleiner Perkins, Li Ka-Shing, Magma Venture Partners and Vertex Venture Capital, started out more than four years ago in Israel and grew out of an open-sourced mapping project. From a tech hub that&#8217;s better-known for B2B and enterprise startups, Waze is one of the real consumer-facing standouts from the Israeli entrepreneurial community.</p>
<p>It has quietly grown from city to city, often initially through traffic and radio announcements that make local drivers aware of the app. That helps them reach critical mass in a metropolitan area and then once they reach a certain tipping point, it snowballs from there. Waze said last month <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2012/09/28/apple-maps-tim-cook-waze-bump/">that it had 26 million users</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/05/waze-20-million/">up from 10 million at the beginning of the year</a>. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/12/confirmed-waze-contributing-to-apples-ios-6-maps-crowd-sourced-traffic-data/">Apple even has a relationship with the company</a>, presumably for feeding data into the main maps app, but neither company has disclosed the nature of that partnership.</p>
<p>Immediately after Apple released and then apologized for its maps app, Waze <a target="_blank" href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-09-28/at-least-someones-happy-about-apple-maps">said its daily downloads jumped from 70,000 per day to 100,000</a>.Â It looks like more than a few of these new users are actually sticking around.</p>
