Earlier this week, the service started rolling out stunning underwater imagery- if you will, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/25/google-maps-goes-diving-provides-seaview-of-great-barrier-reef-hawaii-and-philippines/">a seaview mode</a>. Now Google took to the <a target="_blank" href="http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2012/09/imagery-update-virtually-visit-more.html">Google Maps blog</a> to announces the inclusion of more high resolution images including a major build-out of 45-degree images. </p>
<p>This update brings a lot of new data to the mapping service. Google Maps and Earth now features 17 cities and 112 countries and regions with high-resolution aerial and satellite imagery. In addition, 51 cities can now be viewed in a 45-degree mode including 37 cities in the US and 14 abroad (full list below). It&#8217;s never been easier to burn a little time and escape from your cubical. </p>
<p>Google constantly rolls out updates to its services but it seems this week has featured more news than usual. Perhaps Google is attempting to cash in on all the positive publicity it&#8217;s receiving thanks to the inferior Apple Maps.</p>
<p>Google Maps is currently riding high on the wake of the Apple Maps fiasco. In fact Apple CEO Tim Cook <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/28/tim-cook-apologizes-for-apple-maps-points-to-competitive-alternatives/">issued a formal apology for Maps</a>, suggesting Google Maps and Bing Maps as alternatives until Apple sorts things out. </p>
