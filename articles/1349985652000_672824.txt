Over the past few years, I&#8217;ve seen quite a few &#8220;campaigns&#8221; shake up things on Twitter and Facebook that blew my mind, when it comes to raising money or awareness around important causes.</p>
<p>Today, a new service called <a target="_blank" href="http://Thoughtful.org">Thoughtful.org</a> has launched and I find it to be quite brilliant. Its founder, Derek Rey, has some experience matching brands up with celebrities from his previous startup, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/13/ad-ly-in-play-as-social-sites-look-for-celebrity-connections/">Ad.ly</a>. I wasn&#8217;t really a fan of anyone, let alone celebrities, tweeting out links to things that they knew nothing about, or really cared about at all, and calling them &#8220;Ads.&#8221; It seems like Rey has found the right mix of Ad.ly&#8217;s original model and something that is infinitely more impactful and heartwarming.</p>
<p>Its first &#8220;campaign&#8221; with Carl&#8217;s Jr and Snoop <del datetime="2012-10-11T19:37:28+00:00">Dogg</del> Lion will go live in the next hour or so, and will benefit <a target="_blank" href="http://snoopyfl.net/page.php?page_id=39811">Snoop&#8217;s youth football league</a>. Thoughtful rounds up the brands and celebrities and builds campaigns that make complete sense. </p>
<p>During my own treatment for Hodgkin&#8217;s Lymphoma, I had brands turn me away because I wasn&#8217;t &#8220;marketable&#8221; enough. Can you imagine a company not wanting to support raising money and awareness for cancer treatment simply because someone has a bunch of tattoos? Well, it happened. Thoughtful can change all of that and help a small non-profit get an important voice and launchpad into the world.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a quick video that explains Thoughtful&#8217;s mission:</p>

<h3>Making a dent in the universe</h3>
<p>When you visit <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thoughtful.org/">the site</a>, there&#8217;s not much to see. All of the action will take place on social channels like Twitter, much like today&#8217;s promoted tweet campaign with Snoop. Here&#8217;s the tweet that you might see in your stream, and I highly recommend taking action, because it&#8217;s for a great cause:</p>
<blockquote><p>A homemade biscuit only for the west! @CarlsJr and they supportin Snoop Youth Football! RT this</p></blockquote>
<p>Cause boosted, celeb engaged with brand, everyone&#8217;s happy.</p>
<p>Before you ask, Thoughtful does take a fee, much like any &#8220;agency&#8221; would, because after all, this is helping brands to be seen in a good light, too. Rey says that 10% minimum gross revenue benefits social and environmental causes, chosen by the brand or celebrity, so that&#8217;s good to hear.  For causes, getting the word out often trumps raising money when it&#8217;s just starting out. </p>

<p>Maybe the next time you see a promoted tweet from a celebrity, you might pause for a moment to see which cause it&#8217;s supporting. It could be one that you care about or involves something that has touched your life. In fact, I asked Rey if I could run a campaign, and I&#8217;m pretty sure that it will happen.</p>
<p>I think that this might be the most thoughtful service on the web to date.</p>
