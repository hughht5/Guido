<p>The Toptable-powered booking system went live on lastminute.com at the start of this month &#8212; providing users with real-time restaurant booking across more than 3,500 restaurants in the U.K. The booking system is fully integrated with Lastminute&#8217;s restaurant offers so users can both book a table and gain any site-specific discounts being offered.</p>
<p>Toptable&#8217;s scale appears to have been a key factor in gaining the business. Cumulatively, toptable and OpenTable have seated more than 20 million diners in the UK, according to the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;The restaurant category is a key product line for <a target="_blank" href="http://lastminute.com/">lastminute.com</a>,&#8221; noted Tim Bishop, <a target="_blank" href="http://lastminute.com/">lastminute.com</a> Lifestyle Director, in a statement. &#8220;The breadth of restaurants served by toptable, combined with their best-in-class booking platform, made it a natural partner for our site.&#8221;</p>
