<p>London, 3rd October 2012: JUST EAT, the world’s leading online takeaway ordering service, has consolidated its position as both global leader and number one in Spain with the acquisition of Sinelantal.com, its main competitor in the Spanish market.</p>
<p>The deal will add 1,300 restaurants to Just-Eat.es.  The company plans to grow its network to over 3,000 delivery restaurants in 2013, generating tens of millions of euros of additional revenue for restaurant owners. Sindelantal.com was founded in 2010 by Evaristo Babé and Diego Ballesteros, who will remain with the company to oversee the transition of restaurants and customers to JUST EAT.</p>

Klaus Nyengaard (@klausnyengaard), CEO of JUST EAT, said “Spain is a major area of growth for us, and we are very pleased to be consolidating our position as number one in the region. SinDelantal.com is a business that aligns perfectly with our own values, and we are excited to be welcoming them to the JUST EAT group.”</p>
<p>Jerome Gavin, MD of Just-Eat.es, said “This acquisition will benefit thousands of restaurant owners and hungry internet users all over Spain. We want to provide the takeaway-eating public with as much choice and variety as possible, and SinDelantal.com will help us deliver that. Since we started in Spain, JUST EAT has introduced hundreds of thousands of customers to the idea of ordering takeaway online.  It is catching on at a pace we never imagined prior to launch.  This acquisition will only help that growth continue.”</p>
<p>Evaristo Babé and Diego Ballesteros, founders of SinDelantal.com, added: “We are extremely pleased to be working with the world’s leading player in the industry. We believe that this is great news for the Spanish market and can only benefit the restaurant industry as it embraces e-commerce.”</p>
<p>The acquisition of SinDelantal.com is the first following a £40 million round of funding in April, led by Vitruvian Partners. It comes off the back of a major brand repositioning, launched in the UK with the strapline Don’t Cook, JUST EAT, backed up by a £5 million spend and due to be rolled out to the other countries in JUST EAT over the coming months.</p>
