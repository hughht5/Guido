Now we&#8217;re hearing short-term room-renting site Airbnb is also something else &#8212; one of the very few name-brand startups raising a massive new round of funding these days.</p>
<p>We <a target="_blank" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/airbnb-new-round-2012-9">slipped this rumor</a> into a panel discussion at Disrupt a couple weeks ago, actually, but we&#8217;ve been busy collecting more details. Here&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve got so far: the San Francisco company is raising around $100 million in a third round of funding at a valuation &#8220;north of a billion&#8221; between $2 billion and $3 billion. While many of its lengthy list of current investors are considering participating, we&#8217;re told, a new firm is coming in to lead the outside round.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the attraction, in the troubled-tech-IPO reality of today? The kind of revenue growth that investors want to see. The company takes an average of 10% on every transaction, according to sources familiar with the business (corroborated by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.quora.com/Airbnb/How-much-revenue-is-Airbnb-doing">various other sources</a> over the years). Bookings have been doing the old hockey-stick: 2 million total in June of 2011, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/26/airbnb-5-million-nights-booked-opening-6-new-international-offices-in-q1-2012/">5 million in January</a> of this year, and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/19/airbnb-10-million-bookings-global/">10 million this past June</a>, the company has announced over time.</p>
<p>Assuming that the company can retain the same growth momentum, if one makes the conservative assumption that cheaper listings are more popular &#8212; say, an average night&#8217;s stay at $70 &#8212; it could be grossing annual revenue of around $168 million. If you go higher, say by estimating an average rental rate of $100 (like what <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.reuters.com/small-business/2011/07/01/is-airbnb-growing-too-fast/">Reuters reported in July 2011</a>), you get $240 million.  These revenue estimates bode well for the raise, as the company can justify a solid valuation and good terms.</p>
<p>If bookings continue to grow like they have, the company could hit a total of around 29 million bookings, including 24 million this year.</p>
<p>Our back-of-the-envelope calculations aren&#8217;t precise, of course, but they tell <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/growth.html">the story that matters</a>. Demand for the product (easy, socially verifiable short-term listings) has continued to grow with its ambitious plans for expansion, with the company able to extract a reliable amount of money from each additional booking. The challenges of this mainly international expansion means it&#8217;ll need more cash in its coffers, and hence a new raise.</p>
<p>The company has already <a target="_blank" href="http://www.quora.com/How-much-money-did-Airbnb-raise-What-is-the-companys-financing-history#ans150088">amassed a total of $120 million</a> at a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/30/airbnb-has-arrived-raising-mega-round-at-a-1-billion-valuation/">valuation of more than $1 billion</a> as of its second round.</p>
