<p>Last Thursday <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/27/the-facebook-effect-shutterstock-prices-ipo-shares-at-13-15-to-raise-54-2m-half-its-originally-intended-115m/">Shutterstock went public</a> under the ticker SSTK, becoming the first NY-based tech company to IPO since 2010.</p>
<p>The company sold 4.5 million shares of common stock at $17 per share on the NYSE, and surged 27 percent over the day closing at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-11/shutterstock-surges-after-ipo-priced-above-range-at-17.html">$21.66</a>. Today, the stock closed at<a target="_blank" href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/in?s=SSTK">$23.08</a>. It&#8217;s been what some (and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/12/defining-ipo-success/">not others</a>) are calling a <a target="_blank" href="http://investorplace.com/ipo-playbook/shutterstock-makes-a-picture-perfect-ipo/">picture perfect IPO</a>, and to celebrate, CEO and founder Jon Oringer rang the bell to start trading this morning at the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>After almost a week to let it stew, the CEO seems ready to move forward. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t about this moment,&#8221; said Oringer. &#8220;We have been at this for nine years, and I&#8217;m looking at the next nine years.&#8221; Which can only lead into video.</p>
<p>For many of us, the world is becoming much more imagery-based than anything else. Video games, pictures, video â€” these things are fundamental to the way we consume information.</p>
<p>Oringer explained that when Shutterstock first launched, the DSLR had just dipped below $1,000, and has since become more and more accessible to large masses of people.</p>
<p>&#8220;It takes a lot of people to use these cameras over and over again, to start to get better and better at what they do and what they&#8217;re creating. It happens over time, [...] we can see the progression of our photographers get better and better, and we&#8217;d like to see that with video, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oringer claims that 70 million businesses could use their content. &#8220;All businesses need images to sell their products and services,&#8221; he said. The key is that he&#8217;s operating in the in-between space, cheaper than traditional players but a more comprehensive library than the base-level offerings.</p>
