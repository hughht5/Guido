That includes the cost of repairs, replacement iPhones, and insurance deductibles for plans like the warranties <a target="_blank" href="http://www.squaretrade.com/">SquareTrade</a> offers, and in large part, costs incurred are a result of accidental damage, more so than loss or theft.</p>
<p>The survey claims that just during the past year, more than 30 percent of iPhone owners have damaged their device, and repeat occurrences are fairly common: 17 percent have damaged their devices more than once. Younger iPhone owners tend to be the most accident-prone, according to the results, with one in two iPhone users 35 or under experiencing some kind of accident with their devices.</p>
<p>The major culprits when it comes to what events cause problems? Mostly drops from a decent height, via either just losing grip on the phone (30%), having it fall from someone&#8217;s lap (13%), or it getting knocked off a table (11%). Water damage is also a notable iPhone killer, via either complete immersion (18%) or having something spilled on it (9%).</p>
<p>SquareTrade put together the report using a survey of more than 2,000 iPhone owners, as well as market size data from comScore current as of May 2012. The company has access to a huge pool of damage data around consumer devices because of its trade as a warranty provider, but it&#8217;s also worth noting that that line of business means SquareTrade could be a bit biased in this matter. I&#8217;ll also point out that there&#8217;s no comparative data as to how the iPhone&#8217;s repair costs stack up against other devices, but it is an interesting snapshot of just how immensely popular the iPhone has been, and how even its service market alone represents a massive, multi-billion dollar industry.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s next iPhone makes its way to consumers and store shelves on Friday, and actually looks to be a little less susceptible to accidental damage than its predecessors, with a primarily aluminum back that should better handle drops without taking significant damage. It&#8217;ll be interesting to see if that has a significant effect on iPhone repair and service frequency and overall cost.</p>
