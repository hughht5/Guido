<p>Makerbot has just announced the Replicator 2.0, a brand new Makerbot Replicator with a larger build plate, coated metal chassis, and improved software as well as better print resolution. In short, this is the Makerbot all grown up.</p>
<p>As you can see from the video, the new Replicator is completely rebuilt with new materials and a larger cavity that allows you to make projects of up to 410 cubic inches (11.2” L x 6.0” W x 6.1” H). It now supports 100-micron resolution and is optimized for PLA bioplastic.</p>
<p>Makerbot closed a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/23/makerbot-takes-10-million-in-funding-from-foundry-group-angels/">round of funding last year</a> and they&#8217;re putting it to good use. Besides the new Replicator, the company has opened its first retail space at <a target="_blank" href="https://maps.google.com.tw/maps?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=safari&amp;q=298+Mulberry+Street+new+york&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x89c2598f87872553:0x7430f8a8d5e024fe,298+Mulberry+St,+New+York,+NY+10012,+USA&amp;gl=tw&amp;ei=Ba9ZUMz6EKnemAWemIDICw&amp;ved=0CB4Q8gEwAA">998 Mulberry Street in New York</a>. We were given an exclusive look at the new device and I&#8217;m wildly impressed. The evolution is stunning and considering Makerbot didn&#8217;t have real retail product until last year I&#8217;m amazed at the growth.</p>
<p>3D printing is the future, that&#8217;s for sure. I&#8217;m just amazed that the future got to us so quickly. The Makerbot Replicator 2 will start at $2,199 and is available online and in the store.</p>
