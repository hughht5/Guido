These are the first U.S. deals of their kind for the company originally founded in London but now dual headquartered in San Francisco &#8212; although they are not unprecedented: Huddle says it is already providing similar services to 80% of the UK government.</p>
<p>The first stage of these deployments is a partnership between Huddle and In-Q-Tel (IQT), the non-profit, strategic investment firm that identifies and develops technology solutions for the U.S. Intelligence Community. Huddle tells me that financial terms of this deal have not been disclosed.</p>
<p>When completed, the platform will enable employees in the two groups to discover, access, and work on content with each other, through a framework that has been approved to have the right level of security.</p>
<p>On top of serving 80% of all UK government departments, Huddle is also taking a big part of its spend on cloud services: it says it has secured some 89% of all spend that was allocated to the G-Cloud framework. It also has government clients in Belgium, Italy, Spain, Greenland and Finland.</p>
<p>On of its more milestone events in the UK, which could have been a persuading factor in the decision announced today, is that in July last year, the company developed Huddle IL3, the first commercial public cloud service to be modified and accredited for pan-government collaboration on restricted data.</p>
<p>The move is a mark of how much public sector organizations have been investing in cloud services &#8212; reflecting the wider trend among enterprises. &#8220;Governments worldwide are now placing cloud technology at the heart of their campaigns to increase efficiency and productivity, and reduce IT costs,&#8221; said Alastair Mitchell, CEO, Huddle. </p>
<p>Once this instance has been developed it can be deployed to further agencies and organizations in the U.S. intelligence community. &#8220;We look forward to building upon the companyâ€™s ongoing success in both the government and commercial markets,&#8221; said Robert Ames, SVP for the information and communication technologies practice at IQT.</p>
