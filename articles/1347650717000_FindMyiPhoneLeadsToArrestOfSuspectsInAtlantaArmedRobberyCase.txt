After five women were held up at gunpoint near the Biltmore Hotel last night in the Georgia state capital, police tracked one of their stolen iPhones to an apartment and nabbed the suspects.</p>
<p>A tipster tells us that police used Find My iPhone, the service that Apple makes available to iCloud users who also own iPhone, iPod touch, Mac, and iPad hardware, to track the device. Find My iPhone has helped in arrests a number of times in the past, including in an armed robbery case <a target="_blank" href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2011/11/apple-iphone-app-helps-lapd-catch-armed-robbery-suspect-.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+lanowblog+%28L.A.+Now%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Feedfetcher">reported by the L.A.
