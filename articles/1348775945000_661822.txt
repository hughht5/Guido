Starbucks, Uber cabs, Warby Parker glasses and products from over 100 other partners can be purchased over desktop or mobile for friends who&#8217;ll receive them as digital gift cards or physical shipments.</p>
<p>Facebook Gifts, the rebirth of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/18/facebook-acquires-karma/">gift app Karma Facebook acquired in May</a>, is rolling out to select U.S. users today. The rest of the country will get it soon, and Facebook is mulling over a international launch of Gifts that could pull buyers away from Amazon, eBay, Etsy, and other shopping sites.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how Facebook Gifts works:</p>
<ol>
<li>You see recommendations on your home page of friends celebrating special occasions</li>
<li>Select one an choose a product to buy for them. You can choose the style/size/flavor or leave it up to them</li>
<li>Write a personal message and choose to share the gift privately or on the friend&#8217;s wall.</li>
<li>You can choose to pay immediately, or later before the gift is shipped.</li>
<li>The recipient gets notified of their gift on Facebook desktop on mobile</li>
<li>They and their friends can see the wrapped gift on the wall or news feed</li>
<li>The recipient unwraps the gift, sees what they&#8217;ve been sent, and can selet styles or other options and enter their shipping address. If they don&#8217;t like their gift they can secretly swap it for a similarly priced on.</li>
<li>The sender gets notified as the gift is unwrapped, the card is read, and the gift is shipped</li>
<li>If it&#8217;s a digital gift like a $5 Starbucks credit or free Uber ride, they instantly get it on their phone and can redeem it in the store or the company&#8217;s app</li>
<li>If it&#8217;s a physical product, it&#8217;s packed in a Facebook bag and sent by its manufacturer to the recipient.</li>
</ol>

<p>Karma co-founder Lee Linden didn&#8217;t deny that Facebook Gifts has the potential to compete with big ecommerce sites. &#8220;our goal is to make this the best way to send a gift&#8221;. Watching the demo, I was very impressed. The way Gifts assesses the profile of the recipient and recommends relevant gifts could be huge help to people who like giving but hate shopping.</p>
<p>The product takes advantage of Facebook&#8217;s expansive social graph to solve a major problem with gift giving: not knowing the shipping address of the recipient. By popping them recipient with notification asking them to choose an existing stored address or add a new one right when the gift is bought, there&#8217;s no guess work on the part of the sender.</p>
