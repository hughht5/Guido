Now, the latest robot to hit the market will help you keep your calories down in the process. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pchintl.com/">PCH International</a>, the company that teams with startups and bigger brands to help manufacture and distribute hardware products, has announced its latest project: a partnership with Intuitive Automata to develop <a target="_blank" href="http://www.myautom.com">Autom</a>, a $199 &#8220;healthcare robot coach&#8221; designed to help people lose weight.</p>
<p>Autom, as the robot is called, is designed as a personal lifestyle coach: it takes in data about the person who owns it and gradually adapts its responses to keep you on track. &#8220;The more it learns about the individual user, the more it customizes the feedback advice to keep the individual motivated,&#8221; the companies said in a statement.</p>
<p>The idea here is that although there are dozens of apps and some hardware on the market today designed to help people stay healthy and eat well &#8212; a product of the big interest in &#8220;quantified self&#8221; technology &#8212; having a physical presence sitting in your kitchen, which is learning about and responding to what you do in there, will be a more effective, engaging and fun way of approaching the challenge of losing weight and eating healthy. Intuitive says that this is based on actual researchÂ that indicates that robots &#8220;create a more powerful and long-lasting relationship with the user than a mobile phone app or a computer.&#8221; On top of the $199 price, subscriptions to use the service begin at $19.</p>
<p>The news was announced today by PCH on stage at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.websummit.net/">Dublin Web Summit</a>. PCH is headquartered in Ireland and manufactures its products in China. Other notable deals PCH has made include a partnership with LittleBits in July to produce the company&#8217;s LEGO-style electronic modelling pieces as part of a mass-market push for the hardware company founded by Ayah Bdeir, a TED Fellow and MIT Media Lab alum. In June, PCH also purchased its own design studio <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/15/pch-international/">Lime Lab</a> to get further involved in the design and production process.</p>
<p>Robots and robotics have had a major boost, with crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter giving inventors a new platform for raising funds and attention for their <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;term=robot">big ideas</a>. And people who are better known for their software prowess are also investing in robotics. LittleBits is backed by True Ventures and Khosla Ventures. Foundry Group, which has recently raised a $225 million fund, invests in Modular Robots.</p>
<p>And Dmitry Grishin, the CEO of Mail.ru, has his own robotics investment: Grishin Robotics, which recently made its first investment, $225,000 into <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/21/grishin-makes-first-250k-investment-in-disrupt-hardware-alley-company-double-robotics/">Double Robotics</a>, a TC Disrupt Hardware Alley finalist.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The important thing to look at the hardware and robotics business is that everyone knows you can start a software company with two or three engineers, but now the same goes for hardware and robotics companies,&#8221; Grishin said earlier today on stage at the Web Summit.</p>
<p>PCH says that the intention is to produce Autom on a mass scale &#8220;to help [Intuitive] cater for huge consumer demand.&#8221; A spokesperson for the company says that they are not yet disclosing when it will become available. But here you can see a larger-than-life version on stage from earlier today. Below is the actual size as it will appear on your kitchen counter.</p>
<p>Autom is being developed as part of the PCH Accelerator program, which helps hardware startups bring smart ideas to market.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been exploring the new consumer robotics market and have found a perfect opportunity in helping Intuitive Automata scale and bring Autom to market,&#8221; said Liam Casey, CEO of PCH International, in a statement today. &#8220;Dr. Cory Kidd, founder and CEO of Intuitive, has the vision and energy to make Autom a common device in every home and we are delighted to partner with him to make his vision a reality.&#8221;</p>
