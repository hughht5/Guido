The mobile payments company, which is currently located in the Chronicle Building in downtown San Francisco, will only be moving a short distance away to a location in Central Market (1455 Market Street). The plan is to move into the new building by mid-2013. </p>
<p>In the past year, Square has grown from approximately 150 employees to more than 400, says the company, and has plans to employ nearly 1,000 people by the end of next year. </p>
<p>“We’re grateful for San Francisco’s commitment to technology, and we’re thrilled the city will remain our home,” said Jack Dorsey, co-founder and CEO of Square in a release. “Square businesses have already facilitated more than $300 million in commerce in San Francisco, and there’s so much more we can do to make a difference in the city and around the world.”</p>
<p>Considering Dorsey and Square&#8217;s design focus, it should be interesting to see how the new office turns out. </p>
<p>Square, which made its <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/01/square-makes-its-second-acquisition-buys-design-firm-8020-opens-new-york-office/">second acquisition</a> a few weeks ago, just closed a massive <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/17/square-closes-200m-series-d-from-starbucks-citi-rizvi-at-3-25b-valuation/">$200 million</a> round of funding, reportedly valuing the mobile payments company at $3.25 billion. And in the past three years since it’s been in operation in the U.S., Square has grown from $1 billion in payments processed annually to $8 billion.</p>
<p>The company also <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/05/starbucks-square-rollout-gets-a-launch-date-no-loyalty-card-integration-yet/">landed a major partnership</a> with Starbucks, processing all card transactions across the coffee giant&#8217;s 7,000 stores in the U.S. and mobile payments support. </p>
