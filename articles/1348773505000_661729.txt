The round was led by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/dana-stalder">Dana Stalder</a> at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/matrix-partners">Matrix Partners</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/meyer-malka">Meyer Malka</a>, founder of Bling Nation and co-founder of Lemon, Inc., now of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/ribbit-capital">Ribbit Capital</a>.</p>
<p>The company had previously closed on $1.2 million in seed funding, from NYC&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/metamorphic-ventures-llc">Metamorphic Ventures</a> (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/lewisgersh">Lewis Gersh</a>) and<a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/kickstart-seed-fund"> Kickstart Seed Fund</a> of Salt Lake City (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/gavinchristensen">Gavin Christensen</a>), as well as other angels in a seed round <a target="_blank" href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fuze-network-secures-12-million-in-seed-financing-to-accelerate-growth-of-payments-platform-116718904.html">announced</a> last February. That round had since been extended to include additional money from previous investors as well as new investors, including Insikt Ventures (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesgutierrez">James Gutierrez</a>, founder of Progreso), <a target="_blank" href="http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=528354&amp;privcapId=11855749&amp;previousCapId=121534&amp;previousTitle=IMS%20Health%20Inc.">Gene Lockhart</a> (current Chairman CCFI / former Chairman NetSpend), <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/cbritt">Chris Britt</a> (former SVP Green Dot), <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/tim-coltrell/0/b7/581">Tim Coltrell</a> (former CEO AccountNow), <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jim-jones/13/16a/7aa">James Jones</a> (current CEO AccountNow), <a target="_blank" href="http://parkcityangels.weebly.com/">Park City Angels</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/paulwwozniak">Paul Wozniak</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/jeramylund">Jeramy Lund</a>. In total, the company has raised nearly $5 million to date.</p>
<p>Fuze Network is made up of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fuzenetwork.com/about-us/">veterans</a> from the payments industry who are looking to build a payment solution that will make bill payments easier for billers, retailers and customers. CEO Dave Wilkes previously headed up strategic alliances at Galileo Processing, and was SVP of Sales &amp; Marketing at ProPay. Chief Network Officer Khalid El-Awady, meanwhile, previously managed Visa&#8217;s prepaid reload network and its relationships with load partners like 7-Eleven, Speedway, and others.</p>
<p>At Fuze Network, the team is targeting the demographic who prefers to pay with cash. Wilkes bristles at calling these customers the &#8220;unbanked&#8221; or &#8220;under-banked,&#8221; however, despite the typical positioning that the cash-preferred customer is, in fact, under-banked. (<em>Ahem, glances at headline</em>). &#8220;It&#8217;s the dumbest term I&#8217;ve ever heard,&#8221; he exclaims, &#8220;it&#8217;s not even true. Every customer that we see on our platform has a card, and multiple cards,&#8221; he says. He explains that even customers who carry prepaid cards have, on average, 3.2 other cards in his or her wallet.</p>
<p>What Fuze Network has built is a proprietary network that allows them to facilitate a credit to any card for a consumer. It&#8217;s basically the opposite of the &#8220;cash back&#8221; option on today&#8217;s point-of-sale terminals. Part of this network includes a product called Swipe2Pay, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fuzenetwork.com/blog/fuze-network-launches-swipe2pay-at-finovate-enables-easy-cash-payments-on-virtually-any-card-at-retail-checkouts/">introduced at last fall&#8217;s Finovate conference</a>, which lets any retailer with a POS terminal process a cash payment for any credit card, deposit money to a debit card, or load up a prepaid card without having to make changes to their existing POS infrastructure.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/27/fuze-network-a-payments-company-focused-on-serving-the-unbanked-under-banked-raises-2-5-million/card-load-1/" rel="attachment wp-att-662029"></a>But Wilkes explains that even a POS is not required to use Fuze Network technology. He explained that even a company like Square (not a partner, just an example) could integrate with the network, despite not having traditional POS infrastructure. Instead of connecting a Square account to a bank account, and then waiting a few days while the ACH payment cleared to have access to the money, the Square user could swipe a card, like a debit card or prepaid card, and have the money from their Square account immediately transferred and made available for use.</p>
<p>Supporting this network are a number of other products, like Fuze&#8217;s BillPay Card (pictured above), which lets customers make in-store cash payments for any bill or subscription, like satellite TV and internet, utility bills, credit card bills and more. It&#8217;s not a credit card, debit card, or prepaid card, but more like a customer identity card. Fuze Network works with the biller to identify its cash-paying customers, then mails out the card with easy-to-follow instructions on how it can be used. Other products include tools that help customers find walk-up payment locations (Where2Pay), places to load prepaid cards (Where2Load), bank and ATM finders (Cash Locator), and FuzeFlow, Fuze&#8217;s online platform for processing bank bill payments, BillPay card reloads and more.</p>
<p>Founded in 2009, Fuze Network allows now customers to make payments at 17,000 banks and 100,000 retail locations nationwide. The company currently processes over $25 million per month, and does over 300,000 card transactions (credits onto card accounts) per month.</p>
