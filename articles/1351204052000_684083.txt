He spent nearly seven years at Google. That&#8217;s not all, he is a former Marine Corps Company Commander and holds an MBA from Wharton. Sounds like a big score for Twitter.</p>
<p>This is the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/22/twitter-poaches-former-google-exec-matt-derella-as-new-director-of-agency-business-development/">second former Googler the company has nabbed this week</a>, the other being former Google Exec Matt Derella. He has joined Twitter as &#8220;Director Of Agency Business Development.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Twitter for comment and will let you know if we find out which roll Laraway will be taking on.</p>
<p>This is developing.</p>
