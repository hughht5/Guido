It&#8217;s not clear if Google accidentally filed the report early (which currently still has some editorial comments in it) or if this was on purpose, but a mid-day earnings release like this is highly unusual. One thing that is clear, though, is that the stock market is not happy about this. Google&#8217;s stock is now <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/finance?client=ob&amp;q=NASDAQ:GOOG">down about 9% and currently trades for well under $700</a>. As of 12:50pm EDT, trading in the stock has now been halted, which lends more credence to the idea that this was indeed a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: We now hear that Google requested the trading halt itself.</p>

<p>In its earnings, Google reported $14.10 billion in revenue and an EPS of $6.53, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/18/google-misses-q3-2012-revenue-up-45-percent-to-14-10b-net-income-down-20-percent-to-2-18b/">missing most analysts&#8217; predictions</a>.</p>
<p>We have reached out to Google for comment about the early release of its earnings report and will update this story once we hear more.</p>
