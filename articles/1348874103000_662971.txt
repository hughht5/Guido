<p>The gesture is reminiscent of the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/search/AntennaGate">AntennaGate</a> &#8220;scandal&#8221; which led the company to offer free bumper cases to iPhone 4 owners. This small gesture in turn rotated the scandal away from the common refrain that &#8220;Apple sucks&#8221; to &#8220;Oh, Apple just offered a new thing!&#8221;</p>
<p><br />
The apps are available on the main page of the iOS app store and include paid and free apps. But is suspect that over time we&#8217;ll all forget about this and start listening to Maps and Siri as users begin to forget the horror that was Apple Maps 1.0.</p>
