<p>During his <a href="http://techcrunch.com/events/disrupt-sf-2012/coverage/">TechCrunch Disrupt</a> talk, Khosla explained that the key role of early investors is not funding, but personal attention and guidance. But generating buzz too early can inflate a startup&#8217;s market cap and make them a less lucrative investment of time and money for the top-tier advisors they need. That leads to critical missteps like poor hiring decisions that can doom a startup.</p>
<p>Khosla wasn&#8217;t trying to defame Y Combinator, noting &#8220;There&#8217;s plenty of smart teams out of YC that we fund.&#8221; But he stressed that heavily prepared presentations can backfire. &#8220;Too much of the polish of the five slide deck&#8221; distracts a team and can repel mentors like him.</p>
<p>For a startup that believes it has a great idea, the next thing they need is great execution, and that requires an all-star team and savvy strategy &#8212; elements the right angel or VC firm can offer. A pumped up valuation might help the founders retain more equity, but that doesn&#8217;t matter without success.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/legendary-vinod-khosla-wants-to-hear-your-tofu-startup-pitch/">If your idea is risky</a>, but with a huge upside that isn&#8217;t valued too high, you can gain the support of people like Vinod and his <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/khosla-ventures">Khosla Ventures</a>. &#8221;I spend most of my time recruiting for my companies. Once you hire the wrong people&#8230; it&#8217;s really hard to get a company back on track.&#8221;</p>
<p>So startups are welcome to maximize their valuations and buddy up with whoever accepts their terms, but Khosla doesn&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the right plan. &#8220;My job is not to be an entrepreneur&#8217;s friend. It&#8217;s to drive them to do more and achieve greater heights. That&#8217;s why I never call myself a VC. I call myself a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/vinod-khosla-of-khosla-ventures-its-not-about-funding-the-company-its-about-helping-them/">venture assistant</a>.&#8221;</p>
