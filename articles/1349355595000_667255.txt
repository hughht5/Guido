Now, SmugMug is hoping that success can extend to the iPad, with a new, <a target="_blank" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/camera-awesome/id420744028?mt=8#">universal version of its app</a> that brings a lot of photographer-focused feature to Apple&#8217;s big-screen iOS device.</p>
<p>&#8220;Six months ago when we shipped Camera Awesome, I hadn&#8217;t thought that we would work on an iPad version at all, because I thought that iPads were terrible, awkward devices to take photos on,&#8221; SmugMug CEO Don McAskill said in an interview. &#8220;But we have over 7 million Camera Awesome users, and they, in overwhelming numbers, asked us for an iPad version, and as a company that&#8217;s been fueled by customer feedback its entire life, we thought that we should at least take a look.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tipping point for McAskill, came when he went to a baseball game and saw the sheer number of people who were using iPads, not iPhones, Android phones or point-and-shoot cameras, to take pictures of the action. Hence the decision to make Camera Awesome for iPad first and foremost an update focused on taking pictures. That&#8217;s also what sets it apart from Camera+&#8217;s iPad app, released last week, according to McAskill. Unlike <a title="Camera+ Goes Big, Makes The Leap From iPhone To iPad" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/27/camera-goes-big-makes-the-leap-from-iphone-to-ipad/">Camera+</a>, Camera Awesome can launch right into photo-taking mode, and the app&#8217;s interface is designed around giving photo and movie-shooters all the advantages the extra screen real estate provides.</p>
<p>But maybe the best thing about Camera Awesome for iPad is that it&#8217;s a universal update. That means that you not only get the iPad version for free, but all of the optional filter and upgrade purchases you made in-app also carry over.</p>
<p>McAskill says that future platform expansion plans are also in the works, including the much-requested Android version, but that the platform&#8217;s fragmentation issue is proving a considerable barrier. He&#8217;s also looking at Windows 8, both for phone and tablets, but will take a wait-and-see approach before venturing on to Microsoft devices. Camera Awesome for iPhone and iPad is free, with in-app purchases ranging in price from $0.99 for individual filters to $9.99 to unlock everything.</p>
