According to a new post on the official Google blog, the Google Play Store has crossed 25 billion app downloads; in case you&#8217;re the type to keep track of these things, the news comes just six months after Apple&#8217;s App Store hit that same milestone.</p>
<p>As usual, Google has chosen to commemorate the occasion with a slew of app discounts to push that number of downloads even higher for the next five days. According to a post on Google&#8217;s official blog, titles from developers Gameloft, Electronic Arts, Rovio, runtastic, Full Fat (just to name a few) will be among those being sold for a scant $0.25 starting later today.</p>
<p>If the announcement sounds a bit familiar, it&#8217;s probably because Google has been awfully vociferous about its Play Store momentum lately. Sergey Brin&#8217;s stunning mid-air Glass demo may have stolen the show, but Google offered up some interesting Google Play Store statistics back at Google I/O &#8212; at the time, the company revealed that the Google Play Store had hit 20 billion installs, and saw over 1.5 billion app downloads per month. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s a pretty solid jump from the roughly 1 billion downloads per month the Google Play Store saw back in late April/early May when it crossed the 15 billion download barrier, and at this point there&#8217;s no sign of that download momentum faltering any time soon. </p>
