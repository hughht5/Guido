According to a new post on the <a target="_blank" href="http://officialandroid.blogspot.com/">official Android blog</a>, the Google Play Store has crossed 25 billion app downloads; in case you&#8217;re the type to keep track of these things, the news comes just six months after Apple&#8217;s App Store hit <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2012/03/05Apples-App-Store-Downloads-Top-25-Billion.html">that same milestone</a>.</p>
<p>As usual, Google has chosen to commemorate the occasion with a slew of app discounts to push that number of downloads even higher for the next five days. According to a post on Google&#8217;s official blog, titles from developers Gameloft, Electronic Arts, Rovio, runtastic, Full Fat (just to name a few) will be among those being sold for a scant $0.25 starting later today.</p>
<p>If the announcement sounds a bit familiar, it&#8217;s probably because Google has been awfully vociferous about its Play Store momentum lately. Sergey Brin&#8217;s <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/27/sergey-brin-demos-google-glass-at-io/">stunning mid-air Glass demo</a> may have stolen the show, but Google offered up some interesting Google Play Store statistics back at Google I/O in June &#8212; at the time, the company revealed that the Google Play Store had hit 20 billion installs, and saw over 1.5 billion app downloads per month. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s a pretty solid jump from the roughly 1 billion downloads per month the Google Play Store saw back in <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/07/google-play-about-to-pass-15-billion-downloads-pssht-it-did-that-weeks-ago/">late April/early Ma</a>y when it crossed the 15 billion download barrier, and at this point there&#8217;s no sign of that download momentum faltering any time soon. That growth in downloads is no doubt tied to a bump in Android device activations, there&#8217;s been no shortage of those either &#8212; Android chief Andy Rubin tweeted earlier this month that Google was seeing <a target="_blank" href="https://en.twitter.com/Arubin/status/245663570812100608">1.3 million</a> Android device activations per day (up 400,000 from Rubin&#8217;s last congratulatory tweet back in June). Couple that with the potential for strong holiday sales thanks to hardware partners like Samsung, HTC, Motorola, and Asus (that Nexus 7 should top many a wish list) and it shouldn&#8217;t be long at all before Google see 30 billion app downloads in the rear-view mirror.</p>
