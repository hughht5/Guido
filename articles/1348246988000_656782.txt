It&#8217;s not a password leak or an attack, however, but there&#8217;s concern that passwords aren&#8217;t being well secured on users&#8217; computers. Initially, word was that Pandora was storing cleartext passwords (meaning unencrypted) directly on users&#8217; hard drives, which would have been a major concern. Specifically, those passwords are being stored in the HTML5 local storage area for the www.pandora.com website. However, it appears that the passwords <em>aren&#8217;t</em> being stored in cleartext, but are encrypted using a single static encryption key which is the same for all users. While that&#8217;s a step up from the earlier, more concerning situation, it&#8217;s still a risk.</p>
<p>Details of the issue were first <a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/116797686750161798768/posts/NGV5xQwJywf">posted to Google+</a> by Amber Yust, a software engineer at Google. It was soon after picked up by <a target="_blank" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4551148">Hacker News</a>.</p>
<p>A developer, Marc Bevand, then <a target="_blank" href="http://pandorhack.zorinaq.com/">demonstrated</a> how easy it would be steal a user&#8217;s Pandora password off their computer using a simple hack he created in response to the information.</p>
<p>This is not something that users should immediately freak out about, but it may be worthwhile to change your Pandora password if you access Pandora&#8217;s website on a shared computer or at an Internet cafe, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">especially</span> if that password is one you use across the web for other sites of a more personal and private nature.</p>
<p>That being said, it is generally not considered a best practice to store a website&#8217;s password on a user&#8217;s computer, and if a website is going to do so, then the password should at least be properly encrypted. In fact, it&#8217;s not very common to save passwords in local storage at all. It&#8217;s also only possible in modern web browsers which support HTML5 (like the current versions of Chrome, IE and Safari now do).</p>
<p>In Pandora&#8217;s case, not only are passwords being stored locally, they&#8217;re not properly encrypted. Technical readers can follow the full thread on Hacker News, but the brief explanation is that the passwords are simply being obfuscated (meaning, hidden) using a single encryption key which is the same for everybody, according to <a target="_blank" href="http://pandorhack.zorinaq.com/">Bevand&#8217;s tests seen here</a>. In addition, he says the technique he created, a proof-of-concept hack to steal the Pandora passwords, can also expose users&#8217; IDs and email addresses associated with the Pandora website.</p>
<p>Bevand updated the page to say that Pandora has today partially addressed the issue by removing the password from local storage, but that&#8217;s <em>only</em> the case when the user explicitly logs off. Users who simply close the browser or tab would still be affected.</p>
<p>The consequences of this security vulnerability in the wild are likely to be minimal, because a hacker would need physical access to a computer. However, this could affect users who share computers, like at libraries, institutions, at work, or at Internet cafes. More importantly, it raises the question that if Pandora isn&#8217;t using best practices in protecting passwords on users&#8217; computers, how are they being stored on Pandora&#8217;s own servers, then? If the passwords were also not protected using decent encryption on their end, then a larger-scale hack could put users&#8217; data at greater risk.</p>
<p><em>We&#8217;ve reached out to Pandora to confirm whether it&#8217;s aware of the problem and what the plan is to address this. We&#8217;ll update if/when we hear back. </em></p>
