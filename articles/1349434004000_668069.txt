The video begins with the famous Wayne Gretzky quote that pretty much defines Jobs&#8217; career: &#8220;I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.&#8221;</p>
<p>Steve Jobs passed away October 5 2011, after a battle with pancreatic cancer. His life was maybe the ultimate comeback story, having founded Apple in 1976, only to be pushed out in 1985, and then to return to the company when it was in serious trouble in 1997 to lead it to where it is today.</p>
