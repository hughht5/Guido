The video begins with the famous Wayne Gretzky quote that pretty much defines Jobs&#8217; career: &#8220;I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.&#8221;</p>
<p>Steve Jobs passed away October 5 2011, after a battle with pancreatic cancer. His life was maybe the ultimate comeback story, having founded Apple in 1976, only to be pushed out in 1985, and then to return to the company when it was in serious trouble in 1997 to lead it to where it is today.</p>
<p>A message from Apple CEO Tim Cook follows the video, marking the occasion and discussing Steve and what he&#8217;s meant, and will continue to mean for the company. Here&#8217;s the letter in full:</p>
<blockquote><p>A message from Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO</p>
<p>Steve’s passing one year ago today was a sad and difficult time for all of us. I hope that today everyone will reflect on his extraordinary life and the many ways he made the world a better place.</p>
<p>One of the greatest gifts Steve gave to the world is Apple. No company has ever inspired such creativity or set such high standards for itself. Our values originated from Steve and his spirit will forever be the foundation of Apple. We share the great privilege and responsibility of carrying his legacy into the future.</p>
<p>I’m incredibly proud of the work we are doing, delivering products that our customers love and dreaming up new ones that will delight them down the road. It’s a wonderful tribute to Steve’s memory and everything he stood for.</p>
<p>Tim</p></blockquote>
