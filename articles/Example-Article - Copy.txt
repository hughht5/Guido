The last time the two were on stage together was when AOL bought TechCrunch, in fact. Arrington started off by complementing Armstrong on tripling the AOL stock price &#8211; and he wanted to know: how did you do it?</p>
<p>Operationally, we&#8217;ve been doing a lot better, said Armstrong. We&#8217;ve increased our focus on products, which includes businesses and brands &#8211; including this conference, he said referring to Disrupt. He also mentioned the major patent sale, which was about making sure AOL investors got a good return. (<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/09/aol-sells-800-patents-for-1-billion-to-microsoft-memo-to-staff/">AOL sold $1.1 billion worth of patents to Microsoft in April</a>.)</p>
<p>Arrington then wanted to know about the general vibe at AOL &#8211; and how the board was reacting to all the changes and developments.</p>
<p>Overall our board has gone through a significant stock drop, Armstrong said. We&#8217;ve been doing a major turnaround, and then we had a proxy battle that last for 6 months, he explained. Only in the last few months has it gotten any better.</p>
<p>Does winning feel good?, Arrington asked. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t won yet,&#8221; Armstrong said. Asked what it would look like when AOL actually <em>did</em> win, Armstrong explained that AOL would &#8220;win&#8221; when it&#8217;s &#8220;in a position where it has consistent growth in both of consumers and products.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m happy that things are better, but I see things that are much better in the future.&#8221;</p>
