<p><a target="_blank" href="http://grishinrobotics.com">Grishin</a> is a Moscow-based fund aimed at making personal robots part of the home and office. The company did not disclose the terms of the deal.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.doublerobotics.com">Double</a> is a Y Combinator company and they&#8217;ve already raised 600 pre-orders at $1,999 each. The investment will help the company with its manufacturing and staffing needs.</p>
<p>Mail.ru CEO Dmitry Grishin founded Grishin Robotics to invest in small, early-stage robotics start-ups. This is their first investment.</p>
<p>“Double Robotics’ investment perfectly aligns to our strategy”, said Grishin. “It is a very consumer-oriented product with potential to fit a very wide range of applications and has already proven a strong consumer demand.&#8221;</p>
<p>We got a chance to test Double at Disrupt in San Francisco where the team led remote viewers around the show floor. It&#8217;s a clever, compact product and it&#8217;s surprisingly easy to use. In short, we&#8217;re looking at democratized telepresence as a real thing, not just a weird pipe dream. Ain&#8217;t the future grand?</p>
