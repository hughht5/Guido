Today the company is launching a daily deals service called Best Deals, which is rolling out today in the UK, Italy, Germany, France and Spain. Best Deals will aggregate daily deals on food, travel and more from 12 companies: LivingSocial, Trip Advisor, Qype Deals, iVoucher, Offerum, Lookingo, Lets Bonus, Elgrupazo, Daily Deal, Deal Ticket, Getbazza and Prezzo Felicea. Only users of HTC&#8217;s flagship Windows and Android phones &#8212; Windows Phone 8X and 8S handsets, which launch in November, and HTC One X+, HTC One X and HTC One S &#8212; will be able to get the service, which launches with 1,700 offers in the hopper.</p>
<p>The news comes as HTC has had a disastrous decline in its market share for smartphones. Figures out from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20121025007003/en/Smartphones-Drive-Quarter-Growth-Worldwide-Mobile-Phone">IDC</a> today note that its worldwide smartphone share is down by more than 42% on shipments of 7.3 million units in Q3, although HTC still scrapes into the top-five handset makers with a 4% stake. (Nokia didn&#8217;t make it into the top five for the first time since IDC started tracking smartphone shipments, in 2004.)</p>
<p>This is one of many content offerings that HTC has loaded into its devices over the years to drive more users. Others have included a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/26/htcs-answer-to-icloud-a-new-deal-with-dropbox/">deal with Dropbox</a> for storage, and built-in Beats audio technology for improved quality.</p>
<p>Best Deals is available now on the HTC One X+; in November on the new Windows Phone 8 handsets; and on the One X and One S in an upcoming software update, a spokesperson said. We are still finding out whether HTC plans to take this concept to other markets and will update as we learn more.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear whether Best Deals will be a big deal for the handset maker. We all know about <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22daily+deal+fatigue%22&amp;oq=%22daily+deal+fatigue%22&amp;sugexp=chrome,mod=0&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">daily deal fatigue</a> &#8212; a state of affairs that has driven the leader in this crowded field, Groupon (who is not included in HTC&#8217;s list), to diversify into becoming more of a universal <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/10/groupon-gets-down-to-commerce-releases-newly-acquired-point-of-sale-app-breadcrumb-bundled-with-a-free-ipad/">platform for local commerce</a>.</p>
<p>One approach perhaps to making daily deals attractive again is to make sure that they are connected with the right people at the right time, so this is what HTC is trying to do. HTC says that users will be able to tailor deal offers by preference and interest, and the service will also use your location to identify deals in your vicinity. Best Deals will also be searchable by popularity, discount, price and expiration date.</p>
<p>&#8220;HTC strives to deliver the best web content and services to its customers, Cédric Mangaud, VP of Value-Added Services for HTC, said in a statement. &#8220;We’re excited to be launching a service that gives you the very best deals, in line with your own personal interests, wherever you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>It will also become a route for HTC to push its own products: in addition to the 1,700 deals on offer from its 12 partners, HTC says that those who use Best Deals &#8220;will also benefit from exclusive deals for a range of HTC products and accessories.&#8221;</p>
<p>Offering local deals on an aggregated basis seems like a no-brainer for a company that wants to get closer to its users, and get them more accustomed to the idea of using their handsets for commerce. After all, it&#8217;s only a short step between using your handset to find a deal, and then potentially start using your handset to pay for that and much more. Or so the hope is, at least.</p>
