Today, ticketing startup <a target="_blank" href="http://www.eventbrite.com">Eventbrite</a> is also expanding upon the concept of customer rewards, but in its case, doling out the perks is a decision that&#8217;s being left up to the event organizer &#8211; it&#8217;s not based on who you are or how popular you are on Twitter. Today&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.eventbrite.com/add-perks-for-your-attendees/">launch</a> involves perks from three well-known startups: Uber, RentTheRunway and HotelTonight.</p>
<p>The perks are a way an organizer can both encourage ticket sales and give thanks back to event attendees. Two of the three new perks make sense as debut partners &#8211; black car service Uber is offering $20 off your first ride and HotelTonight is offering $30 off your first booking. For those who are attending an out-of-town event, having access to discounted transportation and lodging is, indeed, a perk. RentTheRunway, which is offering $25 off your purchase, is more of a stretch. But I suppose the idea here is that you need to look <em>good</em> for the conference/concert/gathering/etc.?</p>
<p>Attendees are able to claim their perks after completing their ticket order by clicking on the banner that appears on the confirmation page. Since these perks are essentially customer referrals, both Eventbrite and the startups themselves have something to gain from these new partnerships &#8211; specifically, referral fees and customer sign-ups. Oh, and Eventbrite&#8217;s users don&#8217;t make out too badly, either.</p>
