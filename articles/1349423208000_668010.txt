We&#8217;re busy updating the Apple Store for you and will be back soon&#8221; missive  (h/t to <a target="_blank" href="http://allthingsd.com/20121004/apples-online-store-is-down-sending-customer-anticipation-up/">AllThingsD</a> which spotted the store was AWOL). The store has been down for at least three hours.</p>
<p>Apple typically takes its online store offline ahead of new product launches, but with no Apple event officially scheduled, it&#8217;s not clear what the latest swathe of downtime relates to.</p>
<p>We recently <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/01/report-ipad-mini-press-event-invitations-going-out-october-10/">reported</a> an Apple investor&#8217;s claim that Cupertino plans to send out invites next week to an event that will unveil a smaller iPad &#8212; but the event itself is not apparently due to take place until October 17 so it&#8217;s a little early for Apple&#8217;s store to go offline to get ready to list an iPad mini.</p>
<p>Friday does mark the one-year anniversary of Apple founder Steve Jobs&#8217; death &#8212; but the Apple homepage would seem a more fitting place for a tribute to Jobs.</p>
