The new SDK lets app developers prep their Facebook mobile apps for iPhone 5&#8242;s screen size, native sharing &#8220;sheets&#8221;, ready-to-use UI elements, and a new ad analytics beta.</p>
<p>Native login is big because it lets third-party apps avoid having to ask for a user&#8217;s Facebook email and password. That easier installation process is the first step in the grand equation for how Facebook monetizes its mobile platform.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the full list of features SDK 3.1 offers iOS developers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Native Facebook Login</strong> -Users login to Facebook once through the settings page and then can instantly give Facebook data permissions to apps without entering their email and password</li>
<li><strong>Native Sharing Sheets</strong> &#8211; Apps can populate overlaid sharing sheets to let their users post to Facebook with minimum interruption to their experience</li>
<li><strong>Native, ready-to-use UI controls including Friend Picker, Places Picker, profile picture control, and login control</strong>s &#8211; Lets apps integrate advanced Facebook features easily</li>
<li><strong>Facebook Login support across iOS versions </strong>- Helps developers make sure their app works on old iOS builds</li>
<li><strong>Easy session management</strong> &#8211; Keeps user access token up to date</li>
<li><strong>Improved API support</strong> &#8211; improves API speed</li>
<li><strong>Ad analytics (Beta)</strong> &#8211; Monitor performance of your Facebook mobile news feed ads and how they&#8217;re driving installs</li>
</ul>

<p>Facebook does not want to compete directly with the Android and iOS app platforms, but instead sit as a social layer above apps on any mobile OS. It&#8217;s strategy is not hardware, app, or in-app purchase sales. Instead, it wants every app integrated with Facebook and their users sharing everything they do back to the social network. If it can become the one news feed to rule them all, it can monetize mobile through ads injected into that feed.</p>
<p>It all shakes out to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/01/facebook-mobile-money/">a clear formula for why Facebook loves mobile developers</a> and wants to give them the best possible tools to build on its platform:</p>
<p><strong>Better tools -&gt; more apps and more growth -&gt; more content shared back -&gt; more relevant feed thanks to sorting -&gt; more time spent browsing -&gt; more ad impressions -&gt; more revenue -&gt; Wall Street shutting the fuck up.</strong></p>
