Chicago-based <a target="_blank" href="http://web.mouthee.com/">Mouthee</a> is today officially debuting its website and <a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mouthee/id515426714?ls=1&amp;mt=8">iOS application</a>, which allow users to quickly share reviews of local restaurants and hotels, as well as movies, music and books.</p>
<p>Mouthee co-founder David Pritzker says he first had the idea for the service back in October 2010. &#8220;I had been talking with my co-founder Chad Silver &#8211; he and I were always exchanging recommendations of things between each other. We were talking about how we had gotten frustrated with the existing review platforms that were available,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We had both gotten into situations where we had relied on anonymous reviews that weren&#8217;t exactly all that they were cracked up to be.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/12/mouthees-social-recommendations-platform-makes-it-easy-to-share-word-of-mouth-get-it-reviews/mouthee-1/" rel="attachment wp-att-673274"></a>The other challenge is that there&#8217;s not a good way to share word-of-mouth recommendations between friends very efficiently, he says. Eventually, these frustrations led to the creation of <a target="_blank" href="http://web.mouthee.com/">Mouthee</a>. &#8220;We&#8217;re really trying to combine the best aspects of review sites, on the one hand, with social networks, on the other,&#8221; Pritzker explains.</p>
<p>The iOS application has actually been available for a few months, but it was a soft launch. The company only told friends about it, and to date, there are just &#8220;several hundred&#8221; users on the service. However, the website version of Mouthee is only now going live.</p>
<p>Using the app (or website) is very simple. There&#8217;s a News Feed of recommendations, which you can filter by &#8220;nearby&#8221; or by your friends&#8217; recommendations on the service. When you find something you like, you can also take actions to buy it via the app. For example, you can make reservations through OpenTable, buy a song through Amazon or iTunes, or purchase movie tickets via Fandango. These affiliate sales provide Mouthee&#8217;s initial revenue stream as well.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/12/mouthees-social-recommendations-platform-makes-it-easy-to-share-word-of-mouth-get-it-reviews/mouthee-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-673273"></a>To leave a review, you tap the &#8220;Rec It&#8221; button fill out a few details, and tap on a cute icon for the rating (&#8220;All about it,&#8221; &#8220;Feelin&#8217; It,&#8221; &#8220;Eh,&#8221; or &#8220;Not So Much.&#8221;) And you can search reviews in the &#8220;Get Recs&#8221; section, or use &#8220;Direct Ask&#8221; to ping a friend about what they would suggest. Unfortunately, these requests only flow through Mouthee for now, but Pritzker says that they&#8217;ll add support for SMS and emails &#8220;Asks&#8221; in the future.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a handy, well-built app, but the more important question here is, how does Mouthee plan to compete in this crowded space? We&#8217;ve seen a number of social recommendation apps come (<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/10/toutd-is-now-called-villij-after-the-social-recommendation-platform-buys-a-techstars-alum-and-integrates-its-platform/">Tout&#8217;d</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/10/livestars-personalized-recommendation-service-wants-to-disrupt-yelp-rotten-tomatoes-co/">Livestar</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/25/omg-ellen-bieber-seacrest-fundstamped/">Stamped</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/06/tipflare-netflix-recs-for-everythang/">Tipflare</a>) and go (remember <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/03/kevin-rose-oink-app-store/">Oink</a>?) in recent months &#8211; what will Mouthee do to differentiate? For starters, says Pritzker, some like Stamped only focus on positive reviews, which he finds problematic. &#8220;They have a really cool approach&#8230;but the problem I see with that is that you&#8217;re dealing with an inherently skewed data set,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>And the others? &#8220;Our key focus is really to make this as intuitive and as fun as possible,&#8221; says Pritzker. In other words, they hope you&#8217;ll use Mouthee because you like to &#8211; it&#8217;s that simple.</p>
<p>Because it&#8217;s based in Chicago, many of Mouthee&#8217;s local reviews are for places in that city, but Washington D.C. and NYC also make a showing. There are around 8,000 total reviews on the service today. You can <a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mouthee/id515426714?ls=1&amp;mt=8">download the app in iTunes here</a>, or visit Mouthee on the <a target="_blank" href="http://web.mouthee.com/">web</a>.</p>
