Wireless service revenues accounted for a good chunk of income on the backs of record high profit margin. And once again, analysts were right on the money with Verizon reporting $29B in total operating revenue on a consolidated basis, up 3.9% over last year. The company reported diluted earnings of $.56 per share, up from $.49 per share, a 14.3% increase over the third quarter last year. </p>
<p>Just like last time, Verizon owes much of its performance to its wireless business. Verizon Wireless gained an additional 1.5M postpaid users this past quarter,  up from the 888,000 new contract-bound subscribers the carrier picked up during Q2. This increase drives Verizon&#8217;s total postpaid accounts to 34.8M, a 1% increase from last year. On average Verizon has 2.6 connections per account, up 4% year over year.</p>
<p>Smart phones now account for 53% of Verizon&#8217;s postpaid wireless subscribers. The company has watched this number grow over the last quarters and it&#8217;s now a whopping 50% over 2011&#8242;s levels. </p>
<p>What more than a few wireless buffs spent time pondering in the days leading up to this release was what effect Verizon Wireless’s Share Everything plans would have on the company’s average revenue per user. After all, those shared plans (which are compulsory for new customers) can be more expensive for some individual users, while families and small businesses can end up spending less on service than before. Thanks to the new plans, the retail ARPA grew 6.5% over last year&#8217;s levels to $145.42 per month. Verizon is now reporting on an per-account basis (ARPA) rather than a per-user basis (ARPU)</p>
<p>Verizon did not specify sales of individual devices including the iPhone 5.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s release detailed the 4G LTE rollout, stating that Verizon&#8217;s next-gen network is now available to more than 250M people in 419 markets across the US.</p>
