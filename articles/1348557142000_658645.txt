<p>He stated that Google and Apple do talk &#8220;daily&#8221;, however.</p>
<p>Just what the two companies talk about daily is anyone&#8217;s guess. There could be software and hardware discussions, legal back and forth, hello&#8217;s from old friends or discussions about search, maps and more. From reading Schmidt&#8217;s quotes, he doesn&#8217;t seem to be in a hurry on anything:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have not done anything yet.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;ve been talking with (Apple) for a long time. We talk to them every day.</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s really nothing to reach out to Google on as far as clarification or statement, since Schmidt holds his current role. Consumer reports fluttered out today discussing concerns with the location-guidance app that Apple released with iOS 6.</p>
<p>As I said before, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/19/if-i-were-google-i-wouldnt-release-a-native-ios-6-maps-app-for-six-months/">this could turn into a crazy game of poker</a>. Let Apple suffer a bit and wait a few months. When I <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/23/heres-what-goes-into-making-google-maps-will-apple-be-able-to-recalculate/">visited the Google Maps team in Mountain View last Friday</a>, everyone had their poker faces on about a native Maps app. Publications had reported, incorrectly, that an app was already submitted and sources told Alexia that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/20/crap-maps/">there&#8217;d be an app by December</a>.</p>
<p>It seems like Vegas to me, will Apple lose it all when it comes to Maps? Apple bet on an extremely important core functionality of its device, and I hope it&#8217;s worth it.</p>
