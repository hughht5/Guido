<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/25/us-google-iphone-idUSBRE88O07U20120925">According to Reuters</a>, Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt told a group of reporters in Japan that the company has not submitted a native Google Maps app to Apple as of yet.</p>
<p>He stated that Google and Apple do talk &#8220;daily&#8221;, however.</p>
<blockquote><p>We have not done anything yet.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;ve been talking with (Apple) for a long time. We talk to them every day.</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s really nothing to reach out to Google on as far as clarification or statement, since Schmidt holds his current role.</p>
