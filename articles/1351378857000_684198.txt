Sao Paulo, Brazil and the San Francisco Bay Area are many miles apart, both literally in terms of distance, and figuratively in terms of culture. But one tech startup called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.predicta.com/br">Predicta</a> is taking on the challenge of bridging the gap. </p>
<p>The Sao Paulo-based company, which makes a technology platform to help brands and small and medium businesses build optimized websites for different visitors, this week <a target="_blank" href="http://www.predicta.com.br/pdf/predicta-siteapps_launch.pdf">opened its first office</a> in San Francisco as a hub to sell its SiteApps platform here in the United States. Predicta, which has 150 staffers in Brazil and expects to ramp up to some $60 million in revenue in the next few years (its 2011 sales were reportedly $12 million), is one of the buzzier companies in the Sao Paulo tech landscape.</p>
<p>Overall, it seems that we keep hearing more and more about the heating up of Brazil&#8217;s startup scene, from Silicon Valley venture capitalists <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/22/redpoint-e-ventures-closes-on-130m-brazil-fund/">focusing on the space</a> and razor-sharp entrepreneurs <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/marco-gomes">emerging from the area</a>. So we asked Predicta&#8217;s co-founder and chief innovation officer Philip Klien to stop by TechCrunch TV while he was in town this week to talk about all that&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p>Watch the video embedded above to hear about why a startup like Predicta would invest the time and money to planing a flag here in California, how the American entrepreneurial attitude differs from Brazil&#8217;s (failure is much more of an option here), what regulatory issues should be tackled to let Brazilian tech really flourish, and more. </p>
