<p>The Google  Engine team posted the <a target="_blank" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/google-appengine-downtime-notify/SMd2pDJsCPo">following update</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>At approximately 7:30am Pacific time this morning, Google began experiencing slow performance and dropped connections from one of the components of App Engine.  The symptoms that service users would experience include slow response and an inability to connect to services.  We currently show that a majority of App Engine users and services are affected.  Google engineering teams are investigating a number of options for restoring service as quickly as possible, and we will provide another update as information changes, or within 60 minutes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dropbox and Tumblr also reported outages, pointing to a potential much larger issue across the web.</p>
