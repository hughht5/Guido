Instead of seeing black bars at the top and bottom of the app, iPhone 5 users will now be able to see a bit more of their inboxes on their phones now.</p>
<p>Gmail is obviously an application that greatly benefits from the extra screen estate. Nevertheless, it took Google a while to update the app, even though the company had already released updates for both its Chrome browser and Google Drive. It&#8217;s worth noting, though, that the Gmail app had <a target="_blank" href="http://productforums.google.com/forum/#!category-topic/gmail/iphone-ipad-or-ipod/1Set3RaFH4Q">a few other issues on iOS 6</a>, the only version of iOS that runs on the iPhone 5. Google probably wanted to fix these bugs before releasing this new version.</p>
<p>When Google first launched Gmail for iOS, the launch was somewhat of a disaster, as the app didn&#8217;t actually work. Since then, though, Google has offered regular updates and slowly added a few more features to the app, including, for example, the ability to open links in Chrome for iOS. What&#8217;s still missing, though, is support for multiple accounts, something users have been asking for ever since the app first launched.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://sprw.me/">Sparrow</a>, the popular iOS email client that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/20/google-acquires-iosmac-email-client-sparrow/">Google acquired in July</a>, has officially been put into maintenance mode. And even though the app won&#8217;t get any major feature updates, the developer recently said it will be updated to include support for the iPhone 5&#8242;s larger screen.</p>
<p>If you use Gmail on the iPhone but prefer Apple&#8217;s own mail app, by the way, also take a look at yesterday&#8217;s announcement regarding Google&#8217;s support for CardDAV, which now makes it a lot easier to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/27/google-introduces-an-easier-way-to-sync-gmail-contacts-to-your-iphone/">sync your Google Contacts with Apple&#8217;s native iOS Contacts app</a>.</p>
