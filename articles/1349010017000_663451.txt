<p>To that end, B&amp;N has announced that it has<a target="_blank" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/nook-simple-touch-with-glowlighttm-now-available-for-the-incredible-new-low-price-of-just-119-unbeatable-value-with-no-distracting-ads-2012-09-30"> cut the price</a> of its conceptually similar Nook SimpleTouch with GlowLight from $139 to $119 — the same price as Amazon&#8217;s ad-supported Paperwhite model.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to look at the move as a knee-jerk reaction to Amazon&#8217;s impending Paperwhite Kindle launch, but Barnes &amp; Noble claims it&#8217;s anything but. Apparently, the price cut has been in the works for &#8220;months&#8221; now as part of the company&#8217;s planning, though I&#8217;ve got to wonder if Amazon&#8217;s announcement earlier this month may have helped force B&amp;N&#8217;s hand a bit. After all, it has gotten to be pretty good at using price cuts to try and disrupt some of Amazon&#8217;s thunder &#8212; as Kindle Fire HD rumors picked up steam last August, B&amp;N <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/12/barnes-and-noble-cuts-nook-tablet-prices-as-new-kindle-rumors-surface/">cut the prices of its Nook Tablet line</a>. Of course, Barnes now has some neat new tablets to push, as we head into the holidays, but the move at least keeps those older tablets in competition with Amazon&#8217;s earlier Fire.</p>
<p>B&amp;N may have just made the cut official, but a few retailers were perhaps a bit too quick to pull the trigger. Target and Walmart (two companies that have coincidentally dropped Amazon&#8217;s e-readers from their inventory) both acknowledged the Glowlight-enabled Nook&#8217;s<a target="_blank" href="http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-33198_7-57522921-286/nook-glowlight-e-reader-price-drops-to-$119/"> updated price yesterday</a>. Now the B&amp;N site reflects that pricing change as well, and just in time — the country&#8217;s annual bout of holiday shopping hysteria is just around the corner, and this move toward pricing parity should force consumers to weigh their e-reading options based on each device&#8217;s merits rather than which would hurt their wallets the least.</p>
