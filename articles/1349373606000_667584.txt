It was going to finally usher Windows Phone into the mainstream. It packs the right goods for the job with forward-thinking features such as wireless charging, NFC, and a gorgeous large screen. But none of that matters now. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/06/on-the-nokia-lumia-900-and-how-on-the-nokia-lumia-900-and-how-att-is-the-phones-only-downside/">Like the Lumia 900 before</a>, the Lumia 920 is <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/04/nokia-lumia-920-lumia-820-to-hit-att-shelves-in-november/">exclusive to AT&amp;T</a>. And that&#8217;s just dumb.</p>
<p>Windows Phone is finally ready to stand tall against Android and iOS. It&#8217;s a great platform with many exclusive features and design cues. Even considering HTC&#8217;s upcoming devices, the Lumia 920 was destined to be the flagship of WinPhone&#8217;s growing fleet, ready to carry the standard into battle. But this exclusive deal with AT&amp;T strips the 920 of its potential impact on the mobile battlefield.</p>
<p>The Lumia 900 is also available exclusively from AT&amp;T. That phone launched with much fanfare earlier this year. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/09/att-going-big-with-lumia-900-advertising-could-spend-as-much-as-150-million/">AT&amp;T claimed</a> it was the carrier&#8217;s largest device launch to date. There was a NYC concert and a lot of video ads. But even with all that noise and a killer price tag of $99, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericsavitz/2012/04/09/the-very-strange-easter-sunday-launch-of-the-nokia-lumia-900/">AT&amp;T launched the phone on Easter Sunday</a>. AT&amp;T didn&#8217;t care about the Lumia 900. Don&#8217;t expect anything different this time around.</p>
<p>Most of us paying attention to the mobile wars are quietly rooting for Windows Phone. It&#8217;s hard not to like the system after playing with it for just a few minutes. It features elegance not found in iOS or Android. The front-end allows owners to get in and get out. But the platform still needs help primarily in the app department. Developers haven&#8217;t latched onto Windows Phone simply because it&#8217;s a smaller market share than iOS, Android or even BlackBerry. The Lumia 920 was supposed to help change that.</p>
<p>Nokia and Microsoft needed to get the Lumia 920 out there. It&#8217;s a waste that this phone is only available on one carrier, let alone a carrier that has shown in the past that it doesn&#8217;t know how to launch <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/the-real-windows-phone-problem-is-with-at-t-not-microsoft/3066">or support</a> Windows Phone devices. This phone should have been available on multiple carriers. But instead someone was paid off. Carriers often pay manufacturers large stacks of cash to carry a phone exclusively.</p>
<p>The Lumia 920 is still a fantastic device. This exclusive deal does not remove anything from the 920 itself. However, with its availability limited to AT&amp;T, there is no way the device will sell in the numbers required to make a meaningful impact for Nokia or Windows Phone. Until Nokia and Microsoft get these devices on more than one carrier, the Windows Phone doesn&#8217;t stand a chance to increase its market share.</p>
