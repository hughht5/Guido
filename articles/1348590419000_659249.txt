<p>The deal will give Squawka access to BBH&#8217;s offices globally, while Zag &#8212; BBH&#8217;s ventures division &#8212; will help with marketing, strategy and business operations.  Further terms were not disclosed (here&#8217;s the <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.squawka.com/2012/09/25/squawka-brings-legendary-ad-agency-bbh-on-board-as-shareholder/">write-up on Squawka&#8217;s blog</a>).</p>
<p>Squawka only launched in public beta back in June, offering itself as a companion to the Euro 2012 soccer tournament. The web app allows users to compare teams and players and actions in real-time, generating a live Player Performance Score which can be used to compare the performance of teams and players &#8212; something that has obvious appeal to the in-play betting market.</p>
<p>Currently Squawka offers real-time data visualisation for the English Premier League, La Liga, the Bundesliga, Ligue 1 and Serie A seasons.</p>
<p>Since its launch it&#8217;s attracted advertising from the likes of Domino’s, Gillette and Paddy Power. It also provides stats and real-time data for the recently announced Gillette Football Club &#8212; a partnership between Google and Proctor &amp; Gamble for a dedicated football channel on YouTube.</p>
