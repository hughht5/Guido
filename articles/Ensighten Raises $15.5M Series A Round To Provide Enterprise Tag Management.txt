Startup <a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=648544&amp;action=edit&amp;message=10">Ensighten</a> wants to deliver tags as a service, making it scalable and incredibly fast, and today it&#8217;s announcing a $15.5 million Series A round led by Volition Capital, and including Eastern Advisors and Floodgate Fund to help it do that.</p>
<p>What Ensighten does with tags, which can be things like cookies, pixels, snippets of Javascript or others that let users perform analtyics on their visitors and conversions, is to take a process that would take a huge team and constant vigilance if managed in-house and make it flexible without having to edit the page itself. Basically, it operates a CDN for tags, serving the right ones when needed, and only the right ones, leading to faster performance in terms of page load times for visitors. Ensighten also has mobile-specific offerings that take on the unique challenges on those platforms, like more inconsistent data connections.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a clever angle for a service virtually anyone with a website needs, and one designed specifically to address the pain points of large enterprise customers who might have to manage thousands of tags across a huge number of properties. In an interview, CEO Josh Manion explained that Ensighten is a no-brainer for those kinds of clients, especially since it means that staff working front-line in marketing can make changes to their tagging systems on the fly, initiating new tools and tweaking old ones.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the biggest challenges that I saw among those customers is that they had just a total lack of marketing agility,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They would want to deploy a brand new technology, let&#8217;s say a multivariate testing tool, but it would take them six months or even more before their IT departments would let them make those changes, and then another six months to make a change.&#8221;</p>
<p>Manion said that this round of funding will go towards continued global expansion (Ensighten opened European offices in April), and that it&#8217;ll help further marketing efforts to get the word out about its services. Ensighten has a good lead in this space, and this funding should help it maintain that, especially since competitor Tealium <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cmswire.com/cms/customer-experience/tealium-raises-us105m-in-funding-for-enterprise-tag-management-016537.php">just raised $10.5 million</a> to grow its own business.</p>
