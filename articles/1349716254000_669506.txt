<p>Hands up if you know what <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ericsson.com/">Ericsson</a> does? Yes, we all know about that Sony-Ericsson smartphone <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/12/hands-on-with-the-sony-ericsson-xperia-s-from-ces/">thingamajig</a>. But as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ericsson.com/thecompany/corporate_governance/company_management/hans_vestberg">Hans Vestberg</a>, Ericsson&#8217;s surprisingly youthful CEO and President told me, Ericsson can claim, as much as any other company, to actually run the network. Forty percent of all the world&#8217;s digital infrastructure is provided by Ericsson and 50% of the world&#8217;s smartphone traffic goes through Ericsson, Vestberg explained to me when we met at the <a target="_blank" href="http://sime.nu/event/london/">SIME</a> conference in London. And you ain&#8217;t seen nothing yet, Vestberg insists. By 2017, there will be 15 times more data traveling on the network and there will be 3 times as many networked devices as there actually are people on earth. So Ericsson&#8217;s role &#8211; as the company enabling the Internet &#8211; is only going to become more central in the next few years. But if Ericsson can handle tomorrow&#8217;s network with the ease with which Vestberg dealt with my question about how many babies will be born during our interview, then I&#8217;m confident we are in good hands.</p>
