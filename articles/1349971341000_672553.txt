<p>The company&#8217;s main carrier product is currently the Skyfire Rocket Optimizer, which can supposedly reduce the bandwidth needed to download videos by 60 percent and images by 50 percent, and which Skyfire says is delivering optimized video to &#8220;tens of millions of Americans.&#8221; Skyfire also recently <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/27/skyfire-horizon-toolbar/">launched its Horizon Toolbar</a>, which allows users to access services like Facebook and Wikipedia while browsing other websites.</p>
<p>And although its focus has shifted to creating products for mobile carriers, Skyfire <a target="_blank" href="http://skyfire.com/en/for-consumers/iphone">continues to offer its mobile browser</a>, whose selling points include the ability to play Flash video.</p>
<p>CEO Jeff Glueck tells me the funding will allow Skyfire to grow internationally. All of the company&#8217;s current carrier customers are in North America, he says, although we can expect some international announcements soon. The company also plans to open new offices soon (it&#8217;s based in Silicon Valley, with an office in London) to help with expansion into Eastern Europe, Japan, Southeast Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>Glueck argues that the US has become &#8220;really a leading indicator for where everywhere else is going,&#8221; particularly in the strain that smartphones are placing on carrier bandwidth â€” in the funding press release, he calls the trend &#8220;mobile warming.&#8221; And that&#8217;s one of the main problems Skyfire is trying to solve.</p>
<p>The round was led by new investor Panorama Capital (formerly JP Morgan), with participation from existing investors Verizon Ventures, Matrix Partners, Trinity Ventures, and Lightspeed Venture Partners.</p>
