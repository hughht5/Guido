The program&#8217;s focus, says Google, will be to partner with strong organizations in local communities and to organize Google-led programs that connect the company&#8217;s own teams and tools with entrepreneurs. In addition, Google wants to make sure that it places &#8220;relevant Google tools in the hands of startups as they are getting off the ground and ready to scale.&#8221; To do so, the company has already partnered with a number of accelerators and incubators around the world, including <a target="_blank" href="http://swbay.startupweekend.org/events/startup-weekend-google/">Startup Weekend</a> in the U.S., <a target="_blank" href="http://ihub.co.ke/pages/home.php">iHub</a> in Kenya, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lecamping.org/">Le Camping</a> in France and, starting this week, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.women2.com/">Women 2.0</a>.</p>
<p>The partnership with Women 2.0, for example, will allow the organization to bring its Founder Friday events to more cities over the next year, including Detroit, New Orleans, Sao Paulo, and Moscow.</p>
<p>As part of this launch, a number of Google employees will also organize events in their communities over the next few weeks as part of its <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/entrepreneurs/initiatives/gfe-week.html">Google for Entrepreneurs Week</a>, and the company is partnering with organizations like <a target="_blank" href="http://ideavillage.org/">Idea Village</a> in New Orleans, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.communitech.ca/">Communitech</a> in Waterloo, <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.tetuanvalley.com/about/our-locations">Tetuan Valley</a> in Wroclaw, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bransoncentre.org/SouthAfrica/home.html">Branson Centre of Entrepreneurship</a> in Johannesburg, and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.councilbluffsiowa.com/chamber_of_commerce/">Council Bluffs Chamber of Commerce in Iowa</a> to make this happen.</p>
