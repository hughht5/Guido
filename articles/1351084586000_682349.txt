Console sales fell about 60 percent with DS sales of 970,000 and Wii sales hitting 1.32 million. </p>
<p>The 3DS rose nearly 65%, however, with sales of 5 million units, including 2.1 million 3DS XLs. </p>
<p>Nintendo noted that a number of titles, including New Super Mario Bros. 2 and Mario Kart 7, buoyed 3DS revenue considerably. Nintendo and its partners sold 19.03 million games for the 3DS, which suggests a great deal of interest and support in the platform.</p>
