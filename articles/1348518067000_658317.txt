Yes, the Justin Timberlake-backed whatever-it-is-now has slapped a new coat of paint on something that has already been sold and pushed to the side of the road.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a video demo of what to expect, since you clearly log in daily just to see what&#8217;s new:</p>
<p><div class='embed-vimeo' style='text-align:center;'><iframe src='http://player.vimeo.com/video/50071857' width='520' height='325' frameborder='0'></iframe></div>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://vimeo.com/50071857">The new Myspace</a> from <a target="_blank" href="http://vimeo.com/myspace">Myspace</a> on <a target="_blank" href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>It looks like Pinterest. Ugh.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m not supportive of iteration, a great comeback story or people in general, it&#8217;s that this ship has sailed. More than once. And far, far away.</p>
<p>Getting people to try new things is super difficult, but getting people to circle back to a dead wagon is nearly impossible. For reasons.</p>
<p>My good friend Harrison Weber from The Next Web <a target="_blank" href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/09/24/myspace-teases-completely-rethought-service-believe-not-looks-beautiful/">calls it &#8220;beautiful&#8221;</a>, but Harrison is about 14 years old, so he has forgotten everything that we&#8217;ve been through with good old Tom and Myspace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty things&#8221; don&#8217;t win. Facebook is ugly, has 950M users. Twitter? Boring for the most part. It&#8217;s content that wins.</p>
<p>As a journalist, I see tons of beautiful things. Beautiful isn&#8217;t what makes a product, it&#8217;s the team, the focus and the potential for something great. This thing? Ugh.</p>
