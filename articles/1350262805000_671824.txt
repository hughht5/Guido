<a target="_blank" href="http://www.bonobos.com">Bonobos</a>, the men&#8217;s clothing company, has gained lots of ground since it was founded in 2007 for its presence on the web as a mostly pure e-commerce play. But in recent months, the company, which is headquartered in New York City, has started to make more and more investments in the physical world of brick-and-mortar with &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.bonobos.com/guideshop">Guideshops,</a>&#8221; appointment-only showrooms where customers can try on Bonobos&#8217; wares in person.</p>
<p>Last month, Bonobos opened its third Guideshop in Palo Alto, in the same building as its new Silicon Valley engineering office which will serve as its headquarters for technology operations. We stopped by to get a look at what the Guideshop concept is all about and chat with CTO Michael Hart, who joined Bonobos <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/15/clothing-brand-bonobos-snags-netflix-director-of-engineering/">nearly a year ago from Netflix</a>. </p>
<p>Watch the video above to get a look at the Guideshop and hear Hart talk about why Bonobos is focusing on bricks in addition to clicks, the competitive landscape now that companies such as J. Crew are getting more web-savvy, the Bonobos tech edge, and more.</p>
