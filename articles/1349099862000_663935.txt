The Loop obtained the following <a target="_blank" href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2012/10/01/verizon-responds-to-data-usage-concerns-on-iphone-5-while-connected-to-wi-fi/">statement from Verizon</a> on the issue:</p>
<blockquote><p>Under certain circumstances, iPhone 5 may use Verizon cellular data while the phone is connected to a Wi-Fi network. Apple has a fix that is being delivered to Verizon customers right on their iPhone 5. Verizon Wireless customers will not be charged for any unwarranted cellular data usage.</p></blockquote>
<p>In order to implement the fix, users will have to go to Settings &gt; General &gt; About instead of looking in Software Update. Apple has provided <a target="_blank" href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5526?viewlocale=en_US&amp;locale=en_US">full instructions on its website</a>. This fix should help some of those affected by Wi-Fi issues on the iPhone 5, although there is some indication that other problems still exist for others who&#8217;ve updated to iOS 6 on iPhones and iPads. It&#8217;s unclear exactly how Verizon plans to compensate users for any overage charges they may have incurred, but it seems like customers either won&#8217;t have to worry about it at all, or will be provided with some means to make claims for a refund.</p>
