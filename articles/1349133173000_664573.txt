Recently, the <a target="_blank" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/foursquare/id306934924?mt=8">iOS app</a> gets a simpler design treatment on the Explore tab, along with a new way to find cool places to go and eat.</p>
<p>This appears to be a re-release of a previous update, perhaps with some bug fixes that aren&#8217;t documented in the following copy:</p>
<blockquote><p>With this release, we&#8217;ve updated the Explore tab with a simpler design and brand new search categories to make finding great places even easier. Try it out!</p>
<p>✭ Instantly see friends and top suggestions nearby<br />
✭ Search for a specific place, like &#8220;Joe&#8217;s Diner&#8221;<br />
✭ Search for whatever you&#8217;re craving, like &#8220;Mexican&#8221; or &#8220;nachos&#8221;<br />
✭ Try our new search categories! See only places you&#8217;ve saved to your lists, places you haven&#8217;t been to, places you have been to, or places friends have been.<br />
✭ As always, get directions, menus, hours, photos, tips and more.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also way faster, with a bunch of design tweaks and under-the-hood performance improvements (including on your new iPhone 5 and iOS 6).
</p></blockquote>
<p>For the first time, I&#8217;ve played around with foursquare on the iPhone 5 and it is indeed blazingly fast. What did the company sneak into this update which prompted us to all update today? Things, maybe.</p>
