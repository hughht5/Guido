Atebits was the name of his previous company that was bought by Twitter in 2010. He announced as well that his first project will be a game.</p>
<p>In November 2011, Brichter <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/04/loren-brichter-creator-of-official-twitter-apps-for-mac-and-iphone-leaves-twitter/">left</a> Twitter to work on other projects. Now we finally know what he is up to, and it seems to be a return to his previous endeavours.</p>
<p>Brichter invented the pull-to-refresh interaction in iPhone apps as well as other popular UX mechanisms. For example, users could swipe on a tweet in Tweetie 2.0 in order to reveal a series of actions. That interaction became widely popular as well.</p>
<p>Twitter owns a patent for the pull-to-refresh interaction, but the company has stated that it wouldn&#8217;t use it defensively thanks to the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/17/twitter-announces-innovators-patent-agreement-gives-ip-control-to-engineers-and-designers/">Innovator&#8217;s Patent Agreement</a>.</p>
<p>That is why even Apple started implementing pull-to-refresh in iOS 6 Mail&#8217;s app.</p>
<p>Even though Atebits was acquired by Twitter, Brichter is still using the name. It looks like he is legally allowed to do that.</p>
<p>His app has been in review for 11 days now according to his personal Twitter account:</p>
<blockquote class='twitter-tweet' lang='en'><p>Day 11. Waiting for Review.</p>&mdash; <br />Loren Brichter (@lorenb) <a href='http://twitter.com/#!/lorenb/status/257866744796958720' data-datetime='2012-10-15T15:33:17+00:00'>October 15, 2012</a></blockquote>
<p>Here is the full blog post:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2007 I left Apple and started my own company. In 2010 that company was acquired by Twitter. Today I&#8217;m giving it another shot. Say hello to atebits 2.0.</p>
<p>My goal is simple. Make things. Fun things, useful things, new things, improved things. Some may be popular, some may be failures. But I love creating, so that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to do.</p>
<p>The first thing will be an app and that app will be a game. Can&#8217;t wait to share it with you.</p></blockquote>
