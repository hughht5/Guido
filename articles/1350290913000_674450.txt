If the deal goes ahead Amazon would take a step close to rivals Apple and Samsung by gaining the ability to design and manufacture its own mobile chips.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, Amazon and Texas Instruments had not responded to a request for comment. We&#8217;ll update this story with any response.</p>
<p>TI chips are used in various devices including Amazon&#8217;s Kindle Fire tablet. Calcalist also notes that TI is a supplier to Amazon&#8217;s rival Barnes &amp; Noble&#8217;s Nook e-reader. The paper <a target="_blank" href="http://www.calcalist.co.il/internet/articles/0,7340,L-3583739,00.html">previously reported</a> TI was considering exiting the mobile chips business because of increased focus on integrated technology solutions, and also <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/05/report-intel-gained-just-0-2-of-smartphone-chip-market-in-1h-as-qualcomm-milked-lte-lead/">Intel&#8217;s entrance into the market</a>. TI has lost out to rival chipmakers such as Qualcomm when it comes to gaining significant mobile market share (<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/05/report-intel-gained-just-0-2-of-smartphone-chip-market-in-1h-as-qualcomm-milked-lte-lead/">Qualcomm took 48 percent market share</a> in the first half of this year, according to Strategy Analytics).</p>
<p>Calcalist speculates that the rumoured Apple <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/03/ipad-mini-production-has-kicked-off-says-wsj-7-85-inch-lcd-screen-no-retina-display/">iPad mini</a> could be the catalyst for Amazon to acquire TI. Amazon&#8217;s strategy to compete with the iPad has been to launch cheaper, lower-end tablets sold at cost price &#8211; but if Apple launches a cheaper iPad, that will erode the appeal of Amazon&#8217;s Kindle devices.</p>
<p>However Gartner analyst Carolina Milanesi told <a target="_blank" href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/10/15/us-amazon-texasins-chips-idUKBRE89E09P20121015">Reuters</a> she doubted whether Amazon wants to &#8220;become that intimately involved with hardware&#8221;.</p>
<p>A TI spokeswoman told Calcalist the company does not comment on rumour and speculation.</p>
