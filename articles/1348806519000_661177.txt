<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/founderscard.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="founderscard" title="founderscard" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>For the boot-strapping founders out there, the idea of paying nearly $500 to join a fancy-pants, exclusive club of entrepreneurs may sound a bit antithetical to customer-first, lean-startup ethics. Credit card benefits, miles and Gilt will do just fine. For others, a membership program that brings executive-style perks, like discounts on hotels, airfare, LegalZoom, TripIt, StubHub, not to mention parties, has some serious appeal. </p>
<p>So in 2009, Eric Kuhn created <a target="_blank" href="https://founderscard.com/">FoundersCard</a> for the latter group &#8212; as a way to give entrepreneurs the same kind of elite programs and networking opportunities traditionally reserved for execs of Fortune 500 companies.</p>
<p>Over the last three years, founders have bought in and FoundersCard continues to grow. We took an in-depth <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/29/turning-two-founderscard-pulls-back-the-curtain-on-its-membership-community-for-entrepreneurs/">look at the community when it turned two earlier this year</a>. At the time, it counted 5,000 members among its flock, with the largest contingents in New York, San Francisco and London. </p>
<p>However, hoping to avoid being seen as overly cliquish or exclusionary, the company opened its admission policy from invite-only to one that now allows any entrepreneur to apply (though it continues to pick-and-choose from its applicants.) Today, FoundersCard has a 70 percent acceptance rate, and the community has grown to over 8,000 members. </p>
<p>Of course, there are many services that claim to have elite users, who are the leaders in their field. FoundersCard is one of those, but until now it&#8217;s been unclear who one might expect to find at a FoundersCard party or using its card when checking into a hotel. We&#8217;ve learned from a few reliable sources that members today include craigslist founder Craig Newmark, Digg founder Kevin Rose, Lowercase Capital founder and Twitter investor Chris Sacca, TechStars co-founder David Tisch, TaskRabbit&#8217;s Leah Busque, co-founder of Obvious and former Twitter Product VP Jason Goldman, LivingSocial co-founder Aaron Batalion, Simple&#8217;s Alex Payne, Box co-founder Dylan Smith, Jason Steinberg of Buzzfeed, Ben Lehrer of Thrillist and author and investor Tim Ferriss &#8212; to name a few.</p>
<p>Why? We&#8217;ve learned that one of the bigger draws for the FoundersCard community is its AT&amp;T deal, which allows members to receive 10 percent of standard rates on all voice plans (and on data plans of $30 or more in value). The company is also officially profitable today, thanks to the factthat it doesn&#8217;t pay for these deals, just negotiates them, and parties are sponsored by member companies, allowing them to run a relatively lean operation.</p>
<p>That being said, it&#8217;s easy to notice that FoundersCard perks skew heavily in favor of male founders, which seems to run counter to the company&#8217;s mission to be beneficial to all of its members. Kuhn says that as a result the team is aggressively going after deals with brands that focus on women, from fashion products to gadgets. </p>
<p>FoundersCard also recently launched a few new perks, including Hilton HHonors Gold elite status for any members, something that usually requires 36 nights or 60K points to secure. They&#8217;ve also added six months of MailChimp for free, along with 15 percent off any plan thereafter, as well as 10 percent off any Dropbox for Teams package.</p>
<p>So, while some may bristle a little bit at becoming part of an exclusive entrepreneurial community, considering the benefits include stuff that&#8217;s actually relevant to the startup lifestyle (at least for those who travel, it makes sense. Along with perks mentioned above, the membership includes discounts on Virgin America/Atlantic, Lifthansa, Cathay, Apple, UPS, ZipCar, Gilt City, TaskRabbit, Retrofit, a number of hotels and now Dropbox and MailChimp. </p>
<p>FoundersCard has also offered to give TechCrunch readers a discount to celebrate its new deals. The service usually costs $495 a year, but you can use this coupon to get in for life at $295 a year: FCTECH13. To get the deal, just use the code <a target="_blank" href="http://www.founderscard.com/membership">when you sign up here</a>. </p>
