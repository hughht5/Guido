It is also a sign of Rovio&#8217;s increasing efforts in the Chinese market. Among the international editions will be a Chinese language version of the app, featuring some new recipes and photos, which will sell in Apple&#8217;s Chinese App Store.</p>
<p>After launching its first book app around the genre of cookery, Rovio tomorrow is planning one more step expanding its brand. It&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/10/11/rovio-and-cern-teaming-up-on-education/?a_dgi=aolshare_twitter">announcing a deal</a> with the European nuclear physics research organization CERN to provide it with Angry Birds learning materials as part of &#8220;Rovio&#8217;s new learning brand.&#8221;</p>
<p>While this is one more step away from gaming for Rovio, it&#8217;s still looking to leverage something else the company has really nailed with its Angry Birds franchise: interactivity. Here, it comes in the form of &#8220;informative, surprising, and colorful egg recipes&#8221; and social media integration so that users of the app can spread a bit of egg love with others. (Apologies to those with egg allergies.)</p>
<p>Book apps, indeed, are different from e-books for their often more graphic and interactive interfaces. It may be that with the rise of tablets (as opposed to e-readers), we may see the line between e-books and book apps become even blurrier, with publishers looking to put in more interactivity across all of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to create a cookbook that brings a family together to actively do things together with the characters they all love,&#8221; said Peter Vesterbacka, Mighty Eagle and CMO, in a statement. &#8220;It’s fully interactive at every stage &#8212; from seeing the illustrations come to life to sharing photos with your friends and family.&#8221;</p>
<p>He tells TechCrunch that this is just the first of many book apps to follow, so we may see other themes besides cooking and eggs come into the mix.</p>
<p>The app features the same recipes that were in Rovio&#8217;s Bad Piggies Egg Book when it came out in print in 2011. It also has some nifty features added in: an egg timer, photos of the finished dishes, and eggs that are animated with surprises inside. And because it&#8217;s an app, Rovio can update those with cross marketing and other things as time goes on.</p>
<p>Rovio is working some of its usual pricing strategy with the book. It will retail in the App Store for $4.99 (or local currency equivalent), but if you buy now it costs $.99. More on the book in the video preview below.</p>
