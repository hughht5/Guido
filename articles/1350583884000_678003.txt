It helps users navigate through different partners and all the specific actions that can be taken to prevent bullying, like how to report bullying and education around the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/26/facebook-support-dashboard/">Support Dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>The mutlifunctional Support Dashboard launched earlier this year and Facebook <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/02/facebook-redesigns-help-center-to-suggest-answers-completes-roll-out-of-support-dashboard/">recently announced</a> it&#8217;s available to 100% of its users. This tool lets users track reports they&#8217;ve made about bullying or abuse as they&#8217;re being resolved. </p>
<p>Facebook has had a comprehensive system in place for a while to field <a target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=196124227075034">social reporting</a>, but users often complained that they didn&#8217;t know what happened after they made reports. </p>
<p>The social network is also collaborating with the Ad Council to launch a massive bullying prevention advertising campaign for TV, print and online. </p>
<p>Ad Council content will be prevalent within Facebook&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/stopbullyingspeakup?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts">&#8220;Stop Bullying: Speak Up&#8221;</a> program which has gone into its second year with more than one million likes. </p>
