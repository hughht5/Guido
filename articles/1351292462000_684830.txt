I&#8217;ve worked for quite a few startups and the people who make things tend to interest me more than what they actually make, sometimes.</p>
<p>Along that line of thinking, I visited the Square folks today and had a great conversation about their stance on keeping a cool, calm, collected and connected culture in the office. As you know, the company is <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/22/square-signs-lease-for-new-office-in-san-francisco-to-accomodate-1000-employees-will-move-in-mid-2013/">moving to a bigger space</a> in San Francisco, one that dons an actual &#8220;square.&#8221; Also, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/24/square-makes-first-international-step-mobile-payment-service-now-live-in-canada/">Square has expanded to Canada (eh?)</a>, which is always the first stop for full-on internationalization.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;m learning more about how Square operates as a company, or family if you will, the team showed me a neat internal app that they use to communicate with one another and maintain a &#8220;closeness&#8221;, even when people are out of the office.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t have a name, but here&#8217;s a look:</p>

<p>While I got to see a little more than I can show you here, what I can say is that it&#8217;s really neat. You can check out the entire floorplan of the office, and check the directory of employees. This is helpful since <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/22/square-is-on-an-engineering-hiring-blitz-time-to-fill-up-that-new-office/">Square seems to be on a massive hiring spree</a>.</p>
<p>Employees can even manage the guests that they have coming to the office and get pinged when they arrive. Awesome.</p>
<p>Canadian themed lunch? Yes please:</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure if other companies do this, but I&#8217;ve never experienced it at my previous places of work. Sure, maybe there&#8217;s a third-party app that keeps people connected and chatting, or there&#8217;s email, but never a custom-built app made internally.</p>
<p>I dig it. </p>
<p>Do you like hearing more about company culture and meeting people who actually work there? Let me know in the comments, because it&#8217;s something that I love to do.</p>
