<p>Eighty-five different locations will be visited, which is a pretty new spin on an event. It&#8217;s basically a moving tour throughout the city and the startups that inhabit it. It&#8217;s officially &#8220;innovation month&#8221; thanks to Mayor Ed Lee, so Dick Costolo came to speak about just that.</p>
<p>Battelle asked Costolo about how it has been to find himself on magazine covers, The Today Show, and Charlie Rose. Costolo took it in stride and was very open about a &#8220;Chris Farley&#8221; moment he had at the Charlie Rose show:</p>
<blockquote><p>I blanked and thought: This. Is. Awesome.</p></blockquote>
<p>Costolo also discussed moving Twitter to its new offices, which some think isn&#8217;t in the best of neighborhoods. However, Costolo shared that co-founder Ev Williams was bullish on moving into the large, empty space. The office is actually quite gorgeous and the area it&#8217;s in is getting cleaned up quite a bit. It&#8217;s historic, and Twitter definitely wants to weave that into its culture.</p>
<p>Luckily, the city of San Francisco afforded Twitter some tax breaks which made such a huge move and build-out possible. Costolo said that when the company &#8220;did the math,&#8221; he realized that it would have to work with all aspects of the city to set up what it wanted to do in the building.</p>
<p>The two obviously have a great relationship, as Battelle poked fun by asking Costolo why Twitter hasn&#8217;t installed a slide in the new office as of yet. Costolo did get serious when it came to talking about keeping the company in San Francisco. He said: &#8220;Twitter is a city company,&#8221; and says that the company has three floors at the new office, which houses 1,200 employees.</p>

As far as the future of the service, Costolo feels like there&#8217;s a lot of room for growth. Battelle asked him what he felt was the biggest misconception about Twitter and Costolo quickly replied: &#8220;That you have to tweet to use Twitter.&#8221;</p>
<p>That statement is important as we watch the service transform itself into more than just a communication medium or a social network. It&#8217;s a news source, and a way to discover new people and things. Brands are frothing at the mouth to work with Twitter, and TV networks want a piece of the action.</p>
<p>Regarding how the outside world views Twitter and its size, the CEO isn&#8217;t worried about what people think so much. Making sure the company moves fast is the important part — he says the company spends a lot of time to make sure it drops &#8220;barnacles&#8221; that slow it down. Costolo is in charge, and the company continues to march forward loudly.</p>
