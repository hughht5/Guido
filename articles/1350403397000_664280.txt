The invitations are likely for the unveiling of a smaller tablet device, set for announcement at an October 23 in San Jose at 10 AM PT event.</p>
<p>The <a title="Making Sense Of The iPad Mini Rumors: What To Expect, When, And Why" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/03/making-sense-of-the-ipad-mini-rumors-what-to-expect-when-and-why/">iPad mini is rumored</a> to have a number of different characteristics, including an <a title="Leaked iPad Mini Pics Show Nano-SIM Card Slot, Anodized Aluminum Casing" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/02/leaked-ipad-mini-pics-show-nano-sim-card-slot-anodized-aluminum-casing/">aluminum design with two color options like the latest iPhone 5</a>, cellular network connectivity, a display that may not provide true Retina resolution in order to keep costs down, and an estimated delivery date of late October or early November. There are also rumors that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imore.com/regarding-ipad-36">Apple will introduce a slightly refreshed full-sized iPad</a> at this event, with a Lightning dock connector and slightly improved specs. Price will be the big wildcard here, for the iPad mini especially: <a title="iPad Mini Pricing Framed In Light Of Apple’s Dedication To Margins" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/15/ipad-mini-pricing-framed-in-light-of-apples-dedication-to-margins/">estimates range</a> from as low as $249 to around $399 as a starting price for the new tablet.</p>

If Apple does go in for a large number of configuration options, this could be one of the most significant divergences from its existing product launch strategies to date.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s about all we do really know about the iPad mini: It&#8217;s smaller (probably around 7.85-inches) – and that&#8217;s about it. Apple will go into detail about screen resolution, how it will work for developers, battery life and camera capabilities next week, so stay tuned as we bring you the news live. And look out for news about refreshed Macs, too, including possibly a new <a title="Report: We’ll See The 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro October 23 As Well As The iPad Mini" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/15/report-well-see-the-13-inch-retina-macbook-pro-october-23-as-well-as-the-ipad-mini/">13-inch Retina MacBook Pro and a refreshed iMac design</a>.</p>
