There&#8217;s now <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/video_questions_beta">a page on the YouTube website</a> describing a feature called &#8220;Video Questions Editor Beta,&#8221; which was <a target="_blank" href="http://www.websonic.nl/nieuws/youtube-video-questions-editor-beta-42855">spotted by the Dutch tech site WebSonic.nl</a>.</p>
<p>The page itself is pretty bare-bones, but it describes the feature as a way for &#8220;multiple questions to be displayed on top of your video during playback that a viewer can answer.&#8221; So video producers can add an interactive element to their content — imagine adding little quizzes to an educational video or introducing product questions to a video ad.</p>
<p>I actually managed to sign up my (pretty much nonexistent) YouTube account for the beta, and you can see the question editor above. It&#8217;s pretty straightforward: you just enter the question you want to ask, the point in the video when it should appear, and the answers that a viewer can choose from. You can also identify one of the answers as the correct one, and offer a hint if the viewers guess incorrectly. Afterwards, you can view a summary of the answers on your analytics page.</p>
<p>The beta page does caution that this really is just something YouTube is testing: &#8220;There is no plan for long-term support of the feature and may be removed at any time without prior notification.&#8221; I&#8217;ve emailed the company for comment and will update if I hear back.</p>
