But there have been a few features missing from Box&#8217;s security offerings, and today, the company is filling these gaps. Most notably, the company is adding Two-Step Login Verification.</p>
<p>Box, which just crossed 12 million users globally and signed its largest deal ever in the past quarter, says that these new security features will be showcased next week at BoxWorks, the company’s annual customer conference and industry event. Box is expanding its authentication choices with the introduction of native two-step login verification. </p>
<p>Box has previously supported multi-factor authentication through single sign-on partners like Ping, Okta, Intel, OneLogin and VMWare, but with this new feature, Box is providing this layer of security. Fellow cloud storage company Dropbox <a target="_blank" href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/08/27/dropbox-two-step-login-verification-available-in-experimental-bu/">added</a> two-step login verification in August.</p>
<p>The company has added a new reporting API so businesses can now incorporate Box activity logs in third-party business intelligence platforms. This allows companies to import collaboration data to outside applications. For example, if there is an unusual shift in usage, spikes in traffic on Box or abnormal behavior occur (i.e. a user downloading several hundred files at once), admins can be alerted in real-time and take appropriate action.</p>
<p>Box is also announcing a new, integrated relationship with Proofpoint to offer enhanced security, compliance and control over documents shared via Box. Using the Box API, when a file is uploaded, Proofpoint’s security-as-a-service is notified, will scan the file, and if it finds content in violation of policy, will alert the administrator.</p>
<p>Lastly, Box is enhancing search for admins, giving IT more tools to rapidly find any content, anywhere on Box. Box admins now have more granular enterprise-wide search functionality that provides the ability to see how files are shared within and outside of their company. Files can now be searched by filename, content type, date range, size and context. Additionally, admins can save their most common queries for repeated access through a bookmarked URL.</p>
<p>Box&#8217;s CEO and co-founder Aaron Levie tells us that while all the features mentioned above are important for users, two-step login verification is definitely one of the most powerful additions from a user protection and security stand point. He also highlights the new reporting API as adding new crucial reporting capabilities for IT admins.</p>
<p>Two-step login verification is rolling out this week to customers and the reporting API is available today. The Proofpoint’s security-as-a-service integration will be available in Q1 of 2013. The advanced search capability is available now as part of an admin console beta program for Box Enterprise customers.</p>
