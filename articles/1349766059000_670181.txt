The C Round for the London-based company is being led by new investor Accel Partners, with existing investors Index Ventures and Balderton Capital also participating. The funding bring&#8217;s HouseTrip&#8217;s total raised to date up to $60 million.</p>
<p>Arnaud Bertrand, HouseTrip&#8217;s young CEO and founder (he&#8217;s 27 and started the company when he was 24), tells me that the main use of the money will be to scale up its operations, as HouseTrip looks to rise up above the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.homeaway.com/">many</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flipkey.com/">many</a> other <a target="_blank" href="http://www.luxuryretreats.com/">companies</a>Â that are also going after the same market: private people who want to rent out vacation homes to tourists who don&#8217;t want to stay in a hotel. The company currently offers 130,000 properties &#8212; everything from small studios or luxurious houses &#8212; covering some 15,000 locations, but this is just the tip of the accommodation iceberg. In Europe alone, there are 3 million properties to rent, he says: &#8220;There is a lot of opportunity to grow.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are a number of companies coming at this market from different directions. Airbnb &#8212; which is also <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/26/airbnb-is-raising-a-big-third-round-aiming-for-a-valuation-north-of-2b/">reportedly raising $100 million</a> at the moment &#8212; focuses primarily on rooms rather than full homes; Luxury Retreats (raising its <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/17/with-100m-in-annual-rentals-luxury-retreats-takes-its-first-round-of-funding-5m-led-by-inovia/">first $5 million</a> in September) is looking only at high-end properties. HouseTrip falls somewhere between these two &#8212; or rather, is trying to cover a bit of all of it. Most of the site is given over to home rentals rather than single rooms. Although those are there, Bertrand tells us that this isn&#8217;t the main focus, for now.</p>
<p>What is the main focus is trying to make the process of renting a place to stay as simple as booking a hotel online, with less of the cost and more flexibility and character in exchange.</p>
<p>Although Bertrand acknowledges that &#8220;there have been home rentals, and rental sites, out there for a long time,&#8221; he says what HouseTrip offers is a route, by way of its platform and algorithms, to making the whole process much easier for all involved. He tells the story of a German home owner who he came across when he was first starting HouseTrip. The man had been renting out a second home for 20 years at that point, Bertrand says. He liked HouseTrip so much, and it was so much easier to use than what he&#8217;d been doing before &#8212; cutting out administrative work and more &#8212; that he invested most of his savings into becoming Bertrand&#8217;s backer. &#8220;He came out very well from that,&#8221; Bertrand says with a little laugh.</p>
<p>This is the second area where Bertrand hopes to take HouseTrip: not just growing in terms of properties covered, but in terms of services offered to users on the platform to make the experience even better &#8212; because, after all, getting a nice place to stay without too much hassle will be just as important for the company going forward as having a selection of places on offer will be. Currently the site employs 18 engineers, but Bertrand says he wants to hire more. But he is evasive when asked to describe what other services might be coming up. &#8220;There are things you can do when you reach a certain scale, using the data you collect,&#8221; he says. &#8220;There are things we can do to help the host in many ways.&#8221;</p>
