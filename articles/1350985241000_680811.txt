It is launching new iOS and Windows 8 apps; it is adding 7 more countries to those covered by the service, taking the total to 27; and it has inked a deal with a device company, Lenovo, to preload the app on its Windows 8 tablets, convertible PCs and Android devices.</p>
<p>The new mobile apps will also be joined with the release of an update to the company&#8217;s existing Android app. Meanwhile, the new countries on Rara.com&#8217;s map &#8211;Â Brazil, Mexico, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia, South Africa, Portugal &#8212; point to how it is taking a strategy to aim at both a mix of developed and emerging markets to pick up new users. That puts it in contrast with companies like Spotify, which have gone after more mature markets, banking on the idea that mobile and fixed broadband would be better off there, and people would have more disposable income to buy services like music streaming.</p>
<p>As with Rara.com&#8217;s existing service, the new apps are based around the idea of charging people for content, rather than offering an unpaid service that could potentially convert users into paying subscribers. In Rara.com&#8217;s case the case is 1.99 pounds, euros or dollars per month to access 18 million tracks.</p>
<p>On top of all of this, Rara.com is also continuing to expand its content deals with labels. The latest is an agreement with Merlin, which represents lots of independent labels.</p>
<p>The Lenovo deal follows another partnership that Rara.com inked around the time of its launch, with Sony, where it powers the company&#8217;s Music Unlimited streaming service.</p>
<p>More to com. Refresh for updates.</p>
