<p>There are currently no details on exactly what kind of Minecraft-related publications the U.K.-based publisher will craft, or which markets it plans to launch into, but Egmont confirmed it will launch multiple products next year.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the publisher told TechCrunch: &#8221;No information on publishing programme/target audience yet as the deal is freshly inked &#8212; I can confirm we will be launching next year though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are working closely with Mojang and with Minecraft enthusiasts to create a range of products that will deliver extra depth and breadth of content to engage and inspire fans and to enhance the experience of playing Minecraft,&#8221; she continued. &#8221;Minecraft excites and inspires millions of kids around the world and their appetite for content is obvious from the huge success of the online tutorials posted by passionate fans.&#8221;</p>
<p>David Riley, Managing Director of Egmont Publishing Group added in a statement: &#8220;Publishing rights for this virtual building blocks game represent a huge opportunity for us. The deal is a great fit with Egmont and sits brilliantly amidst our growing portfolio of viral video, social media, virtual world, mobile and online gaming entertainment properties.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last month <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/20/move-over-dr-seuss-rovio-readies-angry-birds-kids-books-partners-with-publisher-egmont/">Egmont inked a deal with Rovio</a> to bring out a line of Angry Birds-related children&#8217;s books in the U.K. Minecraft&#8217;s user base is not quite up there with Angry Birds &#8212; which <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/07/rovios-big-year-angry-birds-helps-gaming-company-soar-to-106m-in-sales648m-downloads/">back in May</a> reported monthly active users of its app at 200 million and total downloads at 648 million &#8212; but Mojang is pushing the Minecraft brand in similar directions, by for example, bringing out an extensive <a target="_blank" href="https://minecraft.net/store">range of Minecraft merchandise</a>.</p>
<p>Mojang is also seeking to monetize the Minecraft community by running <a target="_blank" href="http://minecon.mojang.com/">Minecon</a>: a conference for Minecraft enthusiasts &#8212; this year taking place in November, at Disneyland Paris.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re excited to partner with Egmont to bring Minecraft to a new format,&#8221; said Carl Manneh, CEO of Mojang, in a statement: &#8220;With the help of the amazing Minecraft community we&#8217;re confident that we can help create intriguing content.&#8221;</p>
