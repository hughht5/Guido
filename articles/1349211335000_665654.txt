But venture capitalist and Facebook board member Marc Andreessen said today that&#8217;s looking at things the wrong way. In fact, he argued that great companies have one thing in common — &#8220;a willingness to defer gratification.&#8221;</p>
<p>Andreessen, along with Sheryl Sandberg, was interviewed on-stage by Charlie Rose at the IAB MIXX advertising conference. He said it&#8217;s common to complain about Facebook and other new companies by saying that they&#8217;re just run by &#8220;a bunch of kids,&#8221; &#8220;Facebook will never be able to monetize,&#8221; and that &#8220;it&#8217;s all falling apart.&#8221; Then these companies turn into big businesses, and the critics say, &#8220;Wow, that was a fluke.&#8221;</p>
<p>What&#8217;s actually happening, Andreessen argued, is that before worrying about monetization, companies are focusing on getting other things right, namely the product, the user experience, and &#8220;the R&amp;D engine&#8221; that allows them to continually improve. For example, he said that Facebook beat Myspace because the older social networkb &#8220;over-monetized,&#8221; while at Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg was always &#8220;focused on user value first.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos takes that even further, Andreessen said. He quoted Bezos as saying, &#8220;Amazon is not in business to have a profit margin.&#8221; Sure, the company needs to make a profit, but that doesn&#8217;t mean worrying about &#8220;the near-term optimization of every case.&#8221;</p>
<p>Earlier in the interview, Rose asked Sandberg if Facebook was monetizing more slowly than expected, to which she responded, &#8220;Monetization is an evolution.&#8221; The company is at &#8220;different points along the curve&#8221; with different advertisers, she said, with some of them still trying to understand the Facebook ad model, and others grasping, &#8220;They can&#8217;t just do the same ad campaigns&#8221; as they would in other media.</p>
<p>Andreessen and Sandberg also talked about <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/02/sheryl-sandberg-were-more-afraid-of-losing-by-standing-still/">the need for Facebook to take big risks rather than stand still, which we covered in a separate post</a>.</p>
