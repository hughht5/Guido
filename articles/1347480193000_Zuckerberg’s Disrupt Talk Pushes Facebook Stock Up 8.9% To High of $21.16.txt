The stock <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/zuckerberg-talk-drives-facebook-stock-up-4-6-in-after-hours-trading/">rose in after-hours trading</a> immediately following Zuckerberg&#8217;s fireside chat at TechCrunch Disrupt in San Francisco yesterday, and then jumped again when the market opened today.</p>
<p>The new high today is the highest the stock has traded at in almost a month. The stock closed at $20.91, still a 7.62% increase over yesterday&#8217;s close of $19.43.</p>
<p>In his talk with TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington yesterday, Zuckerberg shared details on Facebook&#8217;s mobile strategy, a major question mark for investors.</p>
<p>He explained that Facebook acknowledged it had <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/mark-zuckerberg-our-biggest-mistake-with-mobile-was-betting-too-much-on-html5/">misjudged HTML5</a> and refocused on its own apps. The social network saw users&#8217; <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/zuckerberg-mobile-users-more-likely-to-be-daily-active-users/">consumption of news feed stories double</a> following the launch of its new iOS app. That&#8217;s a simple but astounding statistic. Double the content consumed. Double the advertising opportunity.</p>

<p>While the stock price surge is nice for Facebook and Zuckerberg, it only really matters if it signals a long-term shift in investors&#8217; perception of Zuckerberg as CEO. If the stock drops again in a few days, then this was just another rise and fall in the long, downward trajectory of a volatile stock.</p>
<p>However, if Zuckerberg&#8217;s widely acclaimed talk convinced shareholders of his strength not just as a founder and entrepreneur but as a professional, mature CEO, then we could be seeing the beginning of a longer, potentially more steady rise for the stock.</p>
<p>Apple announced today that it <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/apples-ios-6-facebook-maps-passbook-photo-sharing-siri-and-more/">has integrated Facebook into iOS 6</a>, a long expected move, which also could have contributed to the increase in stock price.</p>
