Of course, this year <a title="Confirmed: Apple Will Live Stream Today’s iPad Mini Event On Web Site, Apple TV" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/23/confirmed-apple-will-live-stream-todays-ipad-mini-event-on-web-site-apple-tv/">Apple is also live streaming the event itself</a>, via the web and Apple TV, so you can also follow along yourself.</p>
<p>But Apple&#8217;s live stream doesn&#8217;t have our color commentary, and you might also be stuck at work, where spending two hours watching online video is harder to get away with than watching text flow by on a screen. What I&#8217;m saying is, we&#8217;ve got you covered.</p>
<p>Keep an eye out at the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/tag/apple">Apple tag page </a>for more in-depth looks at specific announcements, and follow along with us starting at 10 AM PT/1PM ET as Apple potentially unveils its <a title="Apple Event Preview: iPad Minis And Retina MacBook Pros And iMacs And Mac Minis, Oh My!" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/22/apple-event-preview-ipad-minis-and-retina-macbook-pros-and-imacs-and-mac-minis-oh-my/">iPad mini, a new Retina MacBook Pro, and a whole bunch of other goodies</a>.</p>
