Cloud Drive is Amazon&#8217;s digital locker offering to complete its media offering. As <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/the-kindle-fire-hd-is-amazons-lean-mean-content-selling-machine/">the Kindle Fire</a> is expected to launch in Europe in the coming days, Cloud Drive will allow users to store their photos, music and documents in the cloud and stream this data to a Kindle Fire or a computer.</p>
<p>Users will get 5 GB of free storage when signing up. They can then choose to subscribe at £6 or €8 a year for 20 GB, with more expansive plans available. Prices have been lowered in the U.S. as well. The cheapest plan now starts at $10 a year for 20 GB.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Amazon introduces new features for existing customers. You can now share your files by copying a public link. It is very reminiscent of Dropbox&#8217;s sharing feature. The company now provides a desktop app with a deep integration with iPhoto. Users can choose which album or event to upload, then everything is copied to Amazon&#8217;s servers.</p>
<p>Cloud Drive is an important part of Amazon&#8217;s cloud offering for consumers. With Amazon Cloud Player on Android, iOS or a computer, users can stream their music if they bought it on Amazon MP3 or uploaded it to Amazon Cloud Drive. In the U.S., Amazon Prime comes with a lot of entertainment content as well. Users can read books from Amazon&#8217;s library, stream movies from a large catalog.</p>
<p>Cloud Drive paid subscribers can <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/12/over-a-year-later-amazon-cloud-player-finally-arrives-on-iphone/">store</a> an unlimited number of MP3 or AAC files in the service. It won&#8217;t count towards their storage quota.</p>
<p>Content deals in Europe will be the next important challenge for Amazon. Selling its Kindle Fire without a good content offering is not in its best interest, as Amazon <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/09/amazon-doesnt-want-to-be-more-like-apple-it-wants-to-be-more-like-amazon-com/">doesn&#8217;t make</a> a lot of money from its Kindles. Instead, it bets on selling content and people actually using the device. While delivering Cloud Drive to European users is a first step, Amazon still has a long road ahead, especially when it comes to movie streaming deals.</p>
