Cloud Drive is Amazon&#8217;s digital locker offering to complete its media offering. As the Kindle Fire is expected to launch in Europe in the coming days, Cloud Drive will allow users to store their photos, music and documents in the cloud and stream this data to a Kindle Fire or a computer.</p>
<p>Users will get 5 GB for free when signing up. They can choose to subscribe at £6 or €8 a year for 20 GB. More expansive plans are available as well. Prices have been lowered in the U.S. as well.</p>

<p>Amazon introduces new features as well for existing customers. You can now share your files publicly by copying a public link. It is very reminiscent of Dropbox&#8217;s sharing feature. Amazon releases a desktop app with a deep integration with iPhone. Users can choose which album or event to upload, then everything is copied to Amazon&#8217;s servers.</p>
<p>Cloud Drive is an important part of Amazon&#8217;s cloud offering. With Amazon Cloud Player, users can stream their music if they bought it on Amazon MP3 or uploaded it to Amazon Cloud Drive. In the U.S., Amazon Prime comes with a lot of entertainment content as well. Users can read books from Amazon&#8217;s library, stream movies from a large catalog.</p>
