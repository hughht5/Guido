<p>Investors include New Enterprise Associates, Ignition Partners, 500 Startups, Jeff Lawson (CEO of Twilio), Elliot Loh, Eileen Burbidge, Ullas Naik, Michael Liou, Damien Tanner, Matt Monahan, and Carter Rabasa.</p>
<p>Danielle Morrill, the company&#8217;s CEO, is pretty frank about using the funding to go all out or go home. They&#8217;ll use the funding to hire a back-end engineer to scale up the service. Referly has about 10,000 users now and is growing 45 percent month-over-month. </p>
<p>&#8220;Funding is not actually success. Success is being cash-flow positive, especially if you&#8217;re in a transaction-based business,&#8221; she said. </p>
<p>Part of the round was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/14/refer-ly-lets-regular-folks-earn-affiliate-revenue-for-recommending-products-they-love/">raised through Morrill&#8217;s connections as a former director of marketing at Twilio</a>. (She was the first, non-founding employee.) Another part of it was raised through AngelList. </p>
<p>&#8220;I could not be happier with the people who invested in us,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We tried to pick investors who would have different roles. We asked ourselves, &#8216;Who will be the CEO coach? Who will help us fill out a board? Who can help with user experience and user interface design?&#8221;</p>
<p>So how does Referly work? It takes the long-established practice of affiliate linking and makes it easy for regular, everyday people to tap into it. Online stores across the web, from Amazon to smaller retailers, often give a cut of revenue to other sites that drive them customers who make purchases. But the process to sign-up as a partner in these programs can be time-consuming for regular people. </p>
<p>At Refer.ly, you can go and create special links that track whether you’re driving sales to other sites. If a recommendation does end up with a friend or family member making a purchase, you’ll earn a small commission (which usually ranges from a few percent to 10 percent depending on the product). If you make more than $10, you can take it out, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/04/referly-donations/">donate it charity</a> or share it with friends. Morrill says that she&#8217;s seen cases where a user has made $1,000, but a more realistic rate might be $100 a month or so. </p>
<p>Users can make special pages full of product recommendations around themes like Halloween, Burning Man or <a target="_blank" href="http://refer.ly/emergency_prep__12_items/c/09f702e011c211e2a4ec22000a1d0d51">emergency preparedness</a>. The site has about 10,000 curated stores now.</p>
