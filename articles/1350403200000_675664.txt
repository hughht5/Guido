The app arrived at a time when its competitors were the original, location-based social networks such as Loopt and Brightkite, now <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/loopt">long</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/brightkite">gone</a>. But Glympse survived &#8211; and today, it&#8217;s getting a revamp. The company, which has slowly grown its install base to 3 million users, is updating its mobile apps on Android, iPhone and iPad with several new features, including support for groups, calendar integration, and more.</p>
<p>Although the app looks a lot different now than it did back in <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2009/05/18/glympse-a-hassle-and-worry-free-way-to-share-your-location-minus-the-social-network/">May 2009</a>, the core functionality has evolved very little over the years. Instead of offering a social network for check-ins, Glympse always believed there was value in the more utilitarian functionality of sharing your location with friends on a more individualized basis. That is, instead of making your location continually public to your social network, you would send a Glympse which would automatically share your current location for a set amount of time, allowing friends or colleagues to track your approach as you head their way for a meetup or a meeting. Put simply, it&#8217;s ephemeral, disposable location-sharing.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/16/location-sharing-app-glympse-adds-groups-calendar-integration-to-eliminate-all-those-im-running-late-messages/glympse-map_screen/" rel="attachment wp-att-675736"></a>Today Glympse is hoping to expand adoption with the introduction of new use cases. With Glympse Groups, for example, the idea is to allow a group of users to share their location during common activities, like sporting events, conferences, meetings, or social gatherings. It&#8217;s an idea somewhat reminiscent of the location-sharing apps that made the scene at SXSW 2011 &#8211; for example, Beluga, GroupMe, and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/09/groupme-2-1-sxsw/">the like</a>. (Beluga and GroupMe have since been acquired, the former by Facebook, the latter by Skype. Other competitors weren&#8217;t as fortunate).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, with Glympse&#8217;s newly added Calendar integration, the app allows users to automatically send out location updates associated with a particular event, so participants can avoid the &#8220;on my way&#8221; and &#8220;running late&#8221; emails, calls and texts.</p>
<p>Also arriving today is a &#8220;request a Glympse&#8221; feature, which lets current users request that their friends or family send them a response with their location via Glympse. The feature, of course, requires the recipient to download the app to do so, if they have not done so already.</p>

<p>According to CEO Bryan Trussel, the changes were brought on by a combination of user feedback, analytics, and a bit of intuition. &#8220;The main thrust in the new version of Glympse was moving from solely one-way sharing &#8211; me letting you know where I am &#8211; to mutual sharing, which makes it easier to share location two ways or with a specified group,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;Both of these were possible with the old app, but too cumbersome. For example, now with Request-A-Glympse, it&#8217;s two clicks for me to ask where you are, and a single click to respond.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trussel says Glympse is primarily used by consumers, but the Calendar integration is aimed at attracting business users to the service, as it streamlines the process of sending a Glympse to meeting participants. &#8220;The new feature imports the attendees, the location, and the meeting name and time automatically,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It went from a 30-second to 3-second effort.&#8221;</p>
<p>Glympse <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/22/glympse-raises-7-5-million-to-help-you-share-your-location-a-few-hours-at-a-time/">raised $7.5 million in June 2011</a>, and more recently <a target="_blank" href="http://gigaom.com/mobile/the-car-dashboard-is-not-the-place-to-let-1000-apps-bloom">announced</a> a partnership which sees its service integrated into the dash of 2013 Mercedes-Benz Series A Class vehicles. Trussel also hints that other partnerships with third-parties are on the way. That&#8217;s good news, then, because 3 million users pales in a time when some industry folks are proclaiming <a target="_blank" href="http://cdixon.org/2012/08/03/ten-million-is-the-new-one-million/">10 million is the new 1 million</a>.</p>
<p>You may have lumped Glympse in the location-based social app bucket, the truth is that the startup&#8217;s main competitor is still SMS. &#8220;We&#8217;re comfortable that in many ways we&#8217;re superior now,&#8221; says Trussel. But that&#8217;s a statement that&#8217;s been true of a number of companies which took on SMS with an advanced feature set, but were never able to gain critical mass.</p>
<p>The updated Glympse apps will be rolling out their respective app stores today, or you can <a target="_blank" href="www.glympse.com/get_glympse">download them from here</a> instead.</p>
