<p>For example, the company recently <a target="_blank" href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/netflix-stops-the-cycle-of-human-misery-by-droppin,85317/">cut about 800 hours of programming from A&amp;E and History</a>, and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/04/amazon-partners-with-epix-brings-3000-more-titles-to-prime-instant-video/">its deal with Epix is no longer exclusive</a>.</p>
<p>However, Netflix points out that among the top 10 TV shows, six are available only on Netflix, and not Hulu, Amazon Prime Instant Video, or HBO Go. The company also points to two numbers suggesting that customer&#8217;s are still happy with the service — per-member viewing is up 30 percent year-over-year, reaching a record high, and that voluntary churn, where users cancel the service (versus involuntary churn, where a credit/debit card payment is declined), is &#8220;generally the lowest it as always been.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most of the fuss about content deals is usually being stirred up by the content providers, Netflix suggests — after all, they&#8217;re hoping to convince Netflix and its competitors to pay more. The company writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>In general, to maintain a great service and low prices, we have to be choosy about what we are licensing for Netflix. Given the high volume of programming available on Netflix, titles come into and out of license nearly every day. Suppliers, of course, are incentivized to talk about how important their particular offering is to our service, and it can be concerning to investors to read stories of content nonrenewal.</p></blockquote>
<p>Plus, Netflix will be getting more aggressive with original content next year, with the premiere of David Fincher&#8217;s House of Cards scheduled for February, and the revival of Arrested Development coming later in the spring.</p>
