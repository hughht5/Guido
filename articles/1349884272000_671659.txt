You need multiple windows and notifications and more windows and stuff like that. For me, I enjoy the simple original web version of Twitter, but what do I know. Today, <a target="_blank" href="http://tweetdeck.posterous.com/a-new-look-for-tweetdeck">TweetDeck for all platforms, except iOS, was updated</a>, and you can now go check it out and rejoice.</p>
<p>After <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/02/twitter-to-buy-tweetdeck-for-40-million-50-million/">acquiring the company behind the app</a>, it&#8217;s kind of just hung out there for the hardcore users with no real visual enhancements. Last year, the company gave it an overhaul on the back-end, but no new coat of paint. That changed in a big way today, by letting you change your app theme and fonts. If you want to read tweets in Comic Sans, now you can. I&#8217;m kidding, you can only change the font size.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what the team had to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today we updated the TweetDeck app on all our supported platforms &#8211; web, Chrome, Mac and Windows. The update is live now on <a target="_blank" href="http://web.tweetdeck.com">web.tweetdeck.com</a>. If you use the Windows app, just restart to trigger an auto-update. Chrome app users should restart Chrome to update the app and the updated Mac app is available now in the Mac App Store.</p>
<p>This update makes TweetDeck easier to use with design enhancements, personalization options and the addition of several frequently-requested features.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s a look at the freshness:</p>

<p>Light and airy, but I&#8217;m still not going to use it. For me, TweetDeck is the perfect app for people who want to pay attention to everything without paying attention to anything. By that, I mean, they like noise. I try to cancel the noise out as much as possible and use Twitter as intended, in real-time. If I miss stuff, I trust that my friends will retweet it.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t like the new look? Go back to the darkroom:</p>

<p>Having said all of that that, give TweetDeck a whirl and let us know what you think in the comments. I like consistency, and this refresh is pretty much that for Twitter&#8217;s suite of goodies.</p>
<p>Also, I think I just coined the phrase &#8220;Twittery.&#8221; Maybe. Or not.</p>
