He touched upon Gifts, the c<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/27/facebook-gifts/">ompany&#8217;s big move</a> into commerce. Gifts incorporates user data into suggestions for gifts to buy for friends for birthdays and other events. Facebook earns a percentage of sales when you use it to buy friends physical products or digital gift cards for their birthdays, weddings, or other special occasions.</p>
<p>Zuck said on the call, &#8220;We&#8217;re also excited about the Gifts launch. We&#8217;re in the early days of the launch but there is an opportunity to add more commerce to Facebook over time.&#8221;</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/10/facebook-mobile-birthdays/">written</a> in the past, Gifts has a lot of potential for revenue for Facebook, and the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/28/facebook-shares-gifts-launch/">markets have responded.</a> Clearly, Facebook sees more potential in new commerce tie-ins with the network, so Gifts may be only the beginning.  </p>
