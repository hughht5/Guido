After adding <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/31/dropbox-admits-user-accounts-were-hijacked-adds-new-security-features/">new security features</a> in the wake of an accounts hijacking, and adding support for the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/04/dropbox-gets-integrated-with-samsung-galaxy-camera-galaxy-note-ii/">Galaxy Camera and the Galaxy Note II</a>, the company has now released an update to its iOS app.</p>
<p>Not too long ago, Dropbox added <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/29/dropbox-teams-with-vimeo-for-direct-video-uploads/">direct uploads to Vimeo</a>, and this time the company is stepping it up a notch adding support for Facebook and Twitter. </p>

<p>Dropbox has also integrated support for Facebook messages, just in case you&#8217;re sending a picture, video, etc. that&#8217;s only meant for a specific pair of eyes. </p>
<p>Version 1.5.5 brings with it support for AirPrint as well, and the update is available now in the <a target="_blank" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dropbox/id327630330">Apple App Store</a>. </p>
