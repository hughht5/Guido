As far as I&#8217;m concerned, every single day could be National Cheeseburger Day, because they&#8217;re yummy. Tomorrow is the official day, and foursquare has teamed up with KRAFT to generate some charitable giving based on your potential eating habits.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all quite simple: check-in at Five Guys Burgers and Fries, and KRAFT will donate the equivalent to <a target="_blank" href="http://feedingamerica.org/">Feeding America</a>. Here&#8217;s what <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.foursquare.com/2012/09/17/check-in-for-charity-eat-a-five_guys-burger-kraftfoods-will-donate-to-feedingamerica/">foursquare had to say</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Foursquare’s great for exploring the world around you, but it’s also great for <a target="_blank" href="http://sacburgerbattle.com/">giving back!</a> In honor of tomorrow’s <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.foursquare.com/2012/09/13/points-battles-charity-and-cheeseburgers-national-cheeseburger-day-is-next-week/">National Cheeseburger Day</a>, when you check in at Five Guys Burgers &amp; Fries, KRAFT Cheese will donate the equivalent of a meal to Feeding America, an organization that operates food banks across the United States. The event starts today and lasts for two weeks, so the more burgers, the better!</p>
<p>To make sure your check-in counts, go to <a target="_blank" href="http://kraftcheese.com/checkin">kraftcheese.com/checkin</a> and connect your foursquare account. Visit the Five Guys foursquare page to find the nearest location, and be sure to swing by soon to nom a cheeseburger and support a good cause.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sure, you could skip the burger and check-in and just give to a great cause, but I&#8217;ve found that weaving charitable giving and causes into an event you&#8217;ll be participating in anyway is a great way to get people involved.</p>
<p>If you go to Five Guys tomorrow to celebrate the day, then just be sure to check-in so that your donation is made. As hokey as it might sound, it could actually make a difference for some folks who are less fortunate.</p>
