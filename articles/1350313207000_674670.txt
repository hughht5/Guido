<p>In the press release announcing the site, CEO Russell Glass says his goal is to make Digital Marketing Remix &#8220;a must-read for all B2B marketers&#8221; by  addressing &#8220;the top-of-mind questions marketers have about deploying the right balance of programs to reach and nurture the right audiences, and drive them through the funnel.&#8221;</p>
<p>To do that, Bizo has hired Sean Callahan, the former executive editor of Crain Communications&#8217; magazines <a target="_blank" href="http://www.btobonline.com">BtoB</a> and Media Business.</p>
<p>The current stories on the site&#8217;s front page including a mix of original content and links to other publications. For example, <a target="_blank" href="http://digitalmarketingremix.com/profiles/blogs/trending-mobile-marketing-s-unavoidable-growth">the top headline</a> is a summary of recent posts on <a target="_blank" href="http://paidcontent.org/2012/10/09/mobile-ads-are-booming-with-more-sales-and-more-investment/?utm_source=General+Users&amp;utm_campaign=8b2e3c6225-c%3Amed+d%3A10-10&amp;utm_medium=email">PaidContent</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/184794/bright-spots-notwithstanding-marketers-lag-in-mob.html?edition=52196">MediaPost</a> looking at the growth of mobile marketing, but there&#8217;s also <a target="_blank" href="http://digitalmarketingremix.com/profiles/blogs/remix-data">a look at data from comScore and Bizo</a> about how businesspeople use education and training websites. Other elements of the weekly editorial schedule include contributed columns and Q&amp;As with marketing executives.</p>
<p>In launching the site, Bizo becomes the latest companies who are trying to build an audience in a given industry through content marketing that isn&#8217;t explicitly self-promotional — and who are <a target="_blank" href="http://www.adweek.com/advertising-week/future-journalism-writing-ad-copy-135492">hiring former journalists to run those programs</a>.</p>
