Apple’s Phil Schiller has just officially announced the new iPhone 5 at the company’s massive press event here in San Francisco, less than a year since its predecessor was unveiled.</p>
<p>Some of the news won’t come as much of a shock considering the sheer volume of rumors and leaks lately (even<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/whoops-apple-search-engine-is-revealing-product-news-before-todays-event-iphone-5-new-ipods-new-itunes-confirmed/"> Apple let some details slip</a> earlier today) &#8212; I’m going to resist the temptation to pontificate on every new feature as it&#8217;s revealed (for now, anyway), so let’s get right down to it.</p>
<h4>The iPhone 5</h4>
<ul>
<li>We can finally put the debate to rest — Apple’s newest mobile juggernaut is called the iPhone 5 (despite actually being the sixth iPhone to hit the market).</li>
<li>The long-rumored (and handsome) two-toned design is indeed legitimate, as is the new iPhone’s larger 4-inch Retina Display. And yes, that display runs at 1136 by 640. </li>
</ul>
