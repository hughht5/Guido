That&#8217;s why there&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stereobot.com/home">StereoBot.com</a>, a new service that allows filmmakers, students, app designers, and presenters to buy licenses to innocuous-sounding music for use in projects.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/screen-shot-2012-10-24-at-11-36-06-am.png"></a></p>
<p>The central <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stereobot.com/home">interface is the search system</a>. To find a song or snippet, you enter a topic &#8211; love, war, happiness, jazz, my mom &#8211; and you get a list of potential songs. The site offers previews of each song as well as a very rich tagging system. You then pay a hundred or so dollars for the rights to the track.</p>
<p><br />
The service, based in Cyprus and founded by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/tasos-frantzolas/4/5a2/48">Tasos Frantzolas</a>. Tasos began by running <a target="_blank" href="http://www.soundsnap.com">SoundSnap</a>, a special effect sound market. I mean check <a target="_blank" href="http://www.soundsnap.com/comic_film_fx">this stuff out</a>. </p>
<p>&#8220;This follows the 5 years of success with Soundsnap.com, which is the most high trafficked website for sound effects worldwide,&#8221; Tasos said. They have 700,000 customers including folks from the BBC, Pixar, Disney, Blizzard, and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/tag/Zynga">Zynga</a>.</p>
<p>The site is live now and you can sign up to download songs to go with your apps, games, and (in my case) a black and white historical semi-autobiographical film noir romance based on the story of the hand jive craze in 1950s London (to be released on 2021 starring myself and Lucy Liu (pending contract)).</p>
