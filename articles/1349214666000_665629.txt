<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/deeyoon.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="deeyoon" title="deeyoon" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>The Internet is a great place for arguments, and a new startup called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.deeyoon.com">Deeyoon</a> aims to bring arguments to video.</p>
<p>Of course, there are a bunch of other startups working on video chat. However, none of them seems to have become a huge, sustainable hit yet, and Deeyoon CEO Joe Kalfa says he&#8217;s taking a different approach — not just general, unstructured conversations, but &#8220;live, real-time video debates.&#8221; (Airtime recently moved closer to this model with <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/airtimes-launches-topic-chatrooms-debate-who-should-win-the-disrupt-battlefield/">the launch of topic chatrooms</a>.)</p>
<p>So when you visit the Deeyoon website, you can watch live video of any debates that are happening at the moment, and browse archived versions of older ones. You can start a debate of your own that ohter users can join, or join a debate that someone else suggested. You choose the length of the debate, but Deeyoon then actually structures the discussion (opening statements, rebuttals, etc.) so that it&#8217;s not just two people shouting at each other.</p>
<p>If you want to example of the kinds of conversations can have on Deeyoon, here&#8217;s a particularly impressive example: Jose Canseco (yes, <em>that</em> Jose Canseco, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jose_Canseco">the legendary baseball player</a>) actually <a target="_blank" href="http://deeyoon.com/d/is-jose-canseco-worthy-of-the-hall-of-fame-even-after-juicing/archived">jumped on Deeyoon</a> to debate someone who argued that he doesn&#8217;t belong in the Hall of Fame due to his steroid use. Watching Canseco address these criticisms directly is super-fascinating, even for a non-baseball fan like me.</p>
<p>Kalfa doesn&#8217;t want to limit the debate to the company&#8217;s site — his team has also created a publishing widget, allowing other sites to point their readers to Deeyoon, where they can start a debate related to whatever they were reading about.</p>
<p>Deeyoon is being funded by Kalfa for now. He says made his money in the medical and dental supply business, although he&#8217;s getting more involved in the tech world, with investments in Wahooly, Caplinked, and TweetTV.</p>
