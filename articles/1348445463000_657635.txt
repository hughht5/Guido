<p>The Taiyuan plant is notorious for their mandatory overtime requirements. Quoth Lai:</p>
<div style="margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px;padding-left:15px;border-left:3px solid #ccc;font-style:italic;">An <a target="_blank" href="http://newspaper.jfdaily.com/xwwb/html/2012-08/27/content_870967.htm">undercover report</a> from August mentioned that the Taiyuan plant processed the back casing of the iPhone 5. It also highlighted the company&#8217;s harsh management as well as &#8220;practically compulsory&#8221; over-time work. We don&#8217;t doubt that this riot escalated due to dissatisfaction over working conditions.</div>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/23/foxconn-taiyuan-riot/">Lai found some video</a> from the factory and writers on Weibo are reporting further information about the incident.</p>
<p>UPDATE &#8211; Taiyuan factory workers went on strike last March although this is apparently the first &#8220;fight&#8221; in the factory. The Weibo postings were pulled down and the images are now gone.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/24/us-hon-hai-idUSBRE88N00L20120924">Reuters</a> is reporting that Foxconn&#8217;s representative Louis Woo said:</p>
<div style="margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px;padding-left:15px;border-left:3px solid #ccc;font-style:italic;">&#8220;The fight is over now &#8230; we&#8217;re still investigating the cause of the fight and the number of people involved.&#8221; He said the fight happened in the workers&#8217; dormitory facilities.</div>
