<p>The Taiyuan plant is notorious for their mandatory overtime requirements. Quoth Lai:</p>
<div style="margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px;padding-left:15px;border-left:3px solid #ccc;font-style:italic;">An <a target="_blank" href="http://newspaper.jfdaily.com/xwwb/html/2012-08/27/content_870967.htm">undercover report</a> from August mentioned that the Taiyuan plant processed the back casing of the iPhone 5. It also highlighted the company&#8217;s harsh management as well as &#8220;practically compulsory&#8221; over-time work. We don&#8217;t doubt that this riot escalated due to dissatisfaction over working conditions.</div>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/23/foxconn-taiyuan-riot/">Lai found some video</a> from the factory and writers to Weibo are reporting further information about the incident.</p>
