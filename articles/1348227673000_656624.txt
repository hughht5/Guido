Today MapBox, developers of the open-sourced, crowdsourced OpenStreetMap, today announced a grant of $575,000 from the Knight Foundation, its third from the group, to help improve the core infrastructure of the product &#8212; a boost for open data.</p>
<p>OpenStreetMap, you may recall, is used by Apple for location data for iPhoto &#8212; something it <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/04/apple-finally-gives-proper-credit-to-openstreetmap-in-iphoto-for-ios/">took a while for Apple to acknowledge</a>. We&#8217;ve just looked and it appears that it&#8217;s still using OpenStreetMap in the latest version of iPhoto.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is to use this investment to make it easier to add data to OpenStreetMap, make OpenStreetMap.org more social to support the community as it continues its rapid growth, and make it easier for people to get data out of OpenStreetMap to make their own maps,&#8221; Alex Barth, who leads the data team at MapBox, noted in a <a target="_blank" href="http://mapbox.com/blog/knight-invests-openstreetmap/">blog post</a> announcing the news.</p>
<p>He notes that the tools will continue to remain open source with data stored on platforms like GitHub.</p>
<p>He notes that the company has been working with the Knight Foundation for the past few months, with the basis of that being the commitment to open data.</p>
<p>Given all the hullaballoo over Apple&#8217;s Maps and what <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/20/crap-maps/">Google may or may not do</a> in response to the news, and the fact that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nokia.com">Nokia</a> is also ramping up massively in this space &#8212; Nokia&#8217;s mapping data is one of the key assets that it is managing to leverage in third party deals, at a time when its handset business continues to remain massively challenged; and it&#8217;s also pushing hard present its own handsets as unique and special because of its strength in map data &#8212; this is a key moment for the space.</p>
<p>In that sense, this can help the OpenStreetMap project continue to keep its hat in the ring amidst all of these other proprietary endeavors.</p>
<p>Barth notes, &#8220;We think the work [this funding] allows will make our biggest impact yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others that use the data include Foursquare, NPR and Wikipedia.</p>
