<p>Windows 8, of course, features both the standard desktop interface and the new Windows 8 UI (formerly known as &#8220;Metro&#8221;). The surface, runs Windows RT, doesn&#8217;t offer the full desktop experience, but it does run Microsoft&#8217;s Office suite in the old-school desktop mode.</p>
<p>Cook was clearly taken back a bit by this question and he clearly had to think about his answer. He still didn&#8217;t hold back and, to be fair, his opinion is fairly similar to that of many reviewers.</p>
