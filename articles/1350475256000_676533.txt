In response to a question on gender equality, Romney said that he requested lists of qualified women for his cabinet while governor, and was given &#8220;binders full of women.&#8221; The odd verbal imagery immediately went viral. Tumblr, as per usual, became a magnet for <a target="_blank" href="http://bindersfullofwomen.tumblr.com/">overtly silly image mashups</a>, while the unofficial Facebook page posted anti-Romney opeds written in response to his answer. Before we display the Internet meme-explosion in all its glory, it&#8217;s only fair to the Governor to post his full response:</p>
<blockquote><p>ROMNEY: Thank you. And important topic, and one which I learned a great deal about, particularly as I was serving as governor of my state, because I had the chance to pull together a cabinet and all the<br />
applicants seemed to be men.</p>
<p>And I &#8211; and I went to my staff, and I said, &#8220;How come all the people for these jobs are &#8211; are all men.&#8221; They said, &#8220;Well, these are the people that have the qualifications.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Well, gosh, can&#8217;t we &#8211; can&#8217;t we find some &#8211; some women that are also qualified?&#8221;</p>
<p>ROMNEY: And &#8211; and so we &#8211; we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet. I went to a number of women&#8217;s groups and said, &#8220;Can you help us find folks,&#8221; and they brought us whole binders full of women. I was proud of the fact that after I staffed my Cabinet and my senior staff, that the University of New York in Albany did a survey of all 50 states, and concluded that mine had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America.</p></blockquote>
<p>Almost instantaneously, the Twitter peanut gallery turned into a full-fledged counterattack. Google searches for &#8220;binders full of women&#8221; skyrocketed</p>
<p></p>
<p>A rudimentary <a target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/romneybindersfullofwomen">Facebook page</a> started racking up likes, culminating in over 200K likes by midnight Pacific time. The page started posting anti-Romney op-eds, like with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/17/romney-binders-full-of-women?fb=optOut">this scorching attack</a> from <em>The Guardian,</em> garnering 8,000 likes and 1,700 shares.</p>
<p>Twitter had its own fun, like these priceless tweets from a Big Bird account made famous by Romney&#8217;s threat to cut Sesame Street funding from the first debate.</p>
<blockquote class='twitter-tweet' lang='en'><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t always use binders&#8230;. But when I do, I like them full of women&#8221;
