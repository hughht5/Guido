It&#8217;s now turned its attention to its BlackBerry app &#8212; currently only holding a <a target="_blank" href="http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/reviews/7605/?lang=en">two star rating</a> on BlackBerry App World &#8212; with a much needed update to boost functionality. The <a target="_blank" href="http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/7605/?lang=en">new BlackBerry app</a> is available for BB6 and BB7 and includes several new features and functions &#8212; including the ability to view job changes and new connections in your network, shared posts in the news stream and the day&#8217;s top news from LinkedIn Today.</p>
<p>The app is also now available in eight new languages: German, Spanish, French, Italian, Dutch, Indonesian, Hindi, and Portuguese.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a screenshot of the app&#8217;s Top Stories and recent updates view</p>

<p>The Inbox has also been improved, allowing BlackBerry users to view and respond to invitations and messages in the same place</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/?attachment_id=682313" rel="attachment wp-att-682313"></a></p>
<p>Users can now review their profile, see who&#8217;s viewed their profile and share updates &#8212; as well as browsing through their connections and adding people to their network</p>

<p>All of which sounds like pretty basic functionality &#8212; so it&#8217;s rather surprising it&#8217;s taken LinkedIn so long to furnish BlackBerry users with such key site functions, especially as BlackBerrys are still likely to be a very relevant demographic for a professional social network (albeit a declining demographic versus Android and iOS users). The company put out <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/16/linkedin-redesigns-android-iphone-apps-with-groups-and-more-debuts-html5-mobile-site/">major updates to its Android and iOS apps</a> back in August 2011 &#8212; reorganizing those apps around four main areas: Updates, Inbox, your profile, and groups. Its new BlackBerry app has been realigned on almost the same lines: Updates, Inbox, You, and Networks.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to LinkedIn to ask why it&#8217;s taken so long to update its BlackBerry app versus Android and iOS and will update with any response.</p>
<p>The new BlackBerry app appears to be going down well with users. Here&#8217;s a sample of user reviews posted so far</p>
<blockquote><p>Very easy to navigate. Can now access everything I need from my BB. Awesome job LinkedIn!</p>
<p>1000 times better than the old excuse of an app!! Relevant information that I actually care about and want access to.</p>
<p>Version 2.0 actually makes LinkedIn something I use. Nice job to whoever worked on the upgrade</p>
<p>Really solid update. Much needed improvements.</p></blockquote>
