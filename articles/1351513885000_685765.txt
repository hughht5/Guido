This version offers wireless charging, an 8 MP camera on the back and 1.2 MP camera on the front, as well as LTE support and switchable shells. No word yet on specific availability or pricing â€“ we might see those later today at Microsoft&#8217;s official Windows Phone event.</p>
<p>The Lumia 822 is aimed at entry-level smartphone shoppers and budget buyers, offering a 4.3-inch screen (smaller than its predecessor) and a less impressive camera (though the 822 has a better one than the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/05/nokia-debuts-the-4-3-lumia-820-5mp-camera-1-5ghz-dual-core-s4-processor-8gb-of-storage/">820 it&#8217;s based on</a>, which is headed to AT&amp;T). Judging by statements included in the press release by Nokia Americas President Olivier Puech, we can expect it to be priced competitively with iOS and Android devices aimed at customers new to smartphones. &#8220;With the Nokia Lumia 822, first-time smartphone buyers &#8211; and those ready to switch &#8211; will get high-quality performance on both their device and Verizon Wireless&#8217; incredibly fast 4G LTE network,&#8221; he said in the release.</p>
<p>Full stats are available now on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nokia.com/us-en/products/phone/lumia822/specifications/">Nokia&#8217;s website</a>. The phone has a dual-core 1.5 GHz Snapdragon S4 processor, an 1,800 mAh battery, 1GB of RAM and a microSD slot that supports cards up to 64GB. It also boasts Bluetooth 3.0 and NFC.</p>
<p>The 822 was <a target="_blank" href="http://pocketnow.com/2012/10/12/nokia-822-rumors-price">rumored not to have</a> a swappabble shell earlier in October, so it&#8217;s nice to see that come to the device. Price rumors put it at around $50 on-contract, but we&#8217;ll have to wait and see whether it goes that low.</p>
