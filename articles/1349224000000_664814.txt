<blockquote><p>“Sometimes when you innovate, you make mistakes. It is best to admit them quickly, and get on with improving your other innovations.” &#8212; Steve Jobs</p></blockquote>
<p>A few months ago, former Facebooker <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/sachatueni">Sacha Tueni</a> and Matthias Wagner were working on a Twitter client. Yes, a Twitter client &#8212; several years after Tweetdeck launched and Seesmic pivoted toward being a social media reader. While their <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zerobirdapp.com/">app Zerobird</a> was good at filtering interesting content, investors weren&#8217;t biting. It was also going to be a long uphill battle in the app store and on Twitter&#8217;s increasingly politically complicated platform.</p>
<p>So they took some good advice to heart. Steve Jobs&#8217; advice, in fact. They built a tribute site to the late visionary. It was spartan, with that famous photograph of him sitting in an unfurnished house. They overlaid some of his best advice on that picture.</p>
<p>The barebones site quickly went viral, accumulating 3 million pageviews in about 48 hours. Surprised by the response to such a simple concept, they redid it with other figures. They did it with Yoda, and got 300,000 visitors. Then they did it again with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.changemakrs.com/alberteinstein/insanity-doing-the-same-thing-over-and-over-ag">Albert Einstein</a>, and immediately got 400,000 visitors. Again, they did it with Lady Gaga, and got 700,000 visitors with 16 percent of them clicking through to a music track.</p>
<p>Thus, a new idea was born. What if they built a platform where anybody could share and accumulate bits and pieces of inspirational wisdom? So they created <a target="_blank" href="http://www.changemakrs.com/">Changemakrs</a>, which is a site full of inspirational quotes from different people ranging from celebrities to intellectuals, and even entrepreneurs from this community. It&#8217;s in beta and invited members can piece together quotable advice from anyone else.</p>
<p>It is a kind of brain-dead, simple concept. While there are plenty of quote sites across the web, Tueni says they&#8217;re kind of like Craigslist or eBay with weird, 1995-era web design (see below). Plus, they&#8217;re not designed to be particularly social or viral.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/02/changemakrs/screen-shot-2012-10-02-at-5-24-56-pm/" rel="attachment wp-att-665894"></a></p>
<p>The positives of the concept are that it&#8217;s something that brands may be more willing to advertise against because these figures and quotes are inspirational and generally positive. Red Bull already featured a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.changemakrs.com/">Changemakrs</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.changemakrs.com/ArnoldSchwarzenegger/i-knew-i-was-a-winner-back-in-the-late-sixties">profile of Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>.</p>
<p>But the flipside is that while company has proven this is very viral in a handful of cases with just the right figure, is it broadly repeatable and scalable? And with just regular people instead of world-reknowned entrepreneurs or Star Wars characters? That&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.changemakrs.com/">Changemakrs&#8217;</a> test.</p>
<p>The company is bootstrapping for now, and is four people, with a recent hire of designer <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/brookshassig">Brooks Hassig</a>.</p>
