In his first interview since the IPO, he called his stock performance <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/zuckerberg-on-facebooks-ipo-stock-performance-has-been-disappointing/">disappointing</a> and talked about his <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/mark-zuckerberg-our-biggest-mistake-with-mobile-was-betting-too-much-on-html5/">biggest mistake</a>. Investors focused on the positive comments, including progress in the mobile business, and Facebook&#8217;s market value soared <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/14/us-facebook-stock-idUSBRE88D1L220120914">$6.785 billion</a> after the speech.  It might be the first nearly $7 billion interview. </p>
<p>Besides Zuckerberg, many other founders and entrepreneurs made news earlier in the day. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/kevin-rose">Kevin Rose</a> <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/kevin-rose-were-not-trying-to-lowball-companies-at-google-ventures/">denied a leaked memo</a> from Paul Graham that claimed Google Ventures was lowballing valuations. Benchmark Capital&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/matt-cohler">Matt Cohler</a> told Michael Arrington he <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/benchmarks-matt-cohler-no-new-investments-in-2012/">hasn&#8217;t made any startup investments</a> this year. And Salesforce.com CEO <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/marc-benioff">Marc Benioff</a> talked about how he thinks Google &#8220;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/marc-benioff-google-squandered-its-enterprise-opportunity/">squandered its enterprise opportunity</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another 15 startups presented their demos in the last 3 Battlefield sessions. The first company to present, YourMechanic, wound up <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/techcrunch-disrupt-sf-2012-winner/">winning</a> the Disrupt Cup. It seems like going first helps, as the first company to present the day before was the runner-up.</p>
