If you&#8217;re using Gmail, there&#8217;s a lot of things you can do with it to make it stand out. Basically, so you don&#8217;t lose it. You can filter it to have a label, give it a star or mark it for your priority inbox. Once you open the email though, it&#8217;s important that all of the information presented to you is useful and concise.</p>
<p>Today, Google shared that it has <a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/112893701314508522131/posts/1NW5QuCQApc">streamlined the look of the email you get when someone shares a Google Drive document:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sharing emails just got a facelift.</p>
<p>You may have noticed a more streamlined email design when someone shares a file with you from Google Drive. This new format will hopefully make it easier and faster for you to open files from your email.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s a look:</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what it used to look like:</p>

<p>The old design was well&#8230;<del datetime="2012-10-16T21:54:06+00:00">old</del> ugly as hell. When I used to open them, I&#8217;d completely miss the point of what was being sent because the font was small and it just wasn&#8217;t jumping out at me. While this is a small update, it&#8217;s quite useful if you&#8217;re an email scanner like I am. I don&#8217;t read every email I get, I jump through them as fast as I can so that I can take action quickly.</p>
<p>That old green box used to remind me of a birthday present, but most of the documents that are sent to me are anything but.</p>
<p>This particular tweak helps me scan a bit better, and its good to see the Google teams working together to improve the overall experience of all of its products. Yay.</p>
