If you take a picture with the iPhone 5, and there&#8217;s a bright light that&#8217;s outside of the frame, you&#8217;ll see a purple tint come across the image. </p>
<p>This is possibly due to the Sapphire glass used in the camera&#8217;s lens. As we all know, Sapphire is a purple/bluish gem, and though the purple tint isn&#8217;t noticeable without that bright glare from an off-screen light, it can really fudge up some pictures if the conditions aren&#8217;t just right. The phone is smart enough, however, to compensate in certain situations.</p>
<p>There is also a chance that the purple haze is caused by light overloading the imaging sensor. </p>
<p>When the iPhone 5 was announced, Apple never made mention of any optical coatings, which tend to reduce these types of issues with glare. </p>
<p>We&#8217;ve tested cameras on two separate iPhone 5s and seen the same exact result. Luckily, when a source of bright light is actually inside the frame, there is no purple issue. We&#8217;ve tested the camera in both indoor light (a lamp) and outdoor light (the sun), so there&#8217;s no difference between natural light or otherwise. Though, the issue does seem more pronounced in artificial lighting conditions, when the source is either just out of frame or on the edge of the picture. </p>
<p>There have been a few disappointments with the iPhone 5 &mdash; the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/19/if-i-were-google-i-wouldnt-release-a-native-ios-6-maps-app-for-six-months/">Maps app is abysmal</a>, the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/24/657820/">aluminum back plate scratches like a cat in heat</a>, and there&#8217;s really nothing all that special to be excited about in terms of innovation. But we&#8217;ve all had fun playing around with <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/apple-shows-off-panoramic-photos-better-photo-sharing-in-new-iphone/">Panorama</a>, and it&#8217;s quite impressive that Apple was able to fit the same 8-megapixel sensor in a much thinner frame. </p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Apple to get a comment on the issue, and are waiting to hear back. We&#8217;ll update if they reply. </p>
