But a lot of mobile apps still make it too difficult for users to just, you know, buy stuff. Well, mobile commerce startup <a target="_blank" href="http://www.paydragon.com/">PayDragon</a> wants to make buying items on your phone so easy that there will be nothing to stop users from making a bunch of purchases they&#8217;ll later regret. Like, one-click easy.</p>
<p>PayDragon, which was built by Y Combinator-backed QR code company <a target="_blank" href="http://www.paperlinks.com/">Paperlinks</a>, was launched earlier this year as an <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/12/paydragon-launch/">ultra-easy way to skip lines and place orders</a> at food trucks and other local food vendors. But the new Checkout feature will begin to take the app in a whole other direction.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/?attachment_id=653170" rel="attachment wp-att-653170"></a>Using the new PayDragon iPhone or Android app, users will be able to scan the barcode on almost any commodity or non-perishable grocery item, purchase it with one click, and have it delivered via two-day shipping with no muss or fuss. There&#8217;s no building of shopping carts, reviewing items, or doing a final once-over before clicking &#8220;buy.&#8221; Users just choose an item, click buy, and the item is on its way. </p>
<p>Mobile commerce and two-day shipping aren&#8217;t exactly new &#8212; Amazon has both &#8212; but the simplicity of the new PayDragon app is how the startup hopes to differentiate itself. CEO Hamilton Chan demoed the app to me in Los Angeles last week, and I was surprised by how easy it is, perfect for instant gratification for users who can&#8217;t be bothered to run to the grocery store or the nearest pharmacy whenever they&#8217;re out of toothpaste. Want to buy two of an item? Go back and click &#8220;buy&#8221; twice. </p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the perfect dude&#8217;s app,&#8221; Chan said. In addition to just providing near-instant gratification, the app also incentivizes users to buy with too-cutesy animations, a gamification aspect that gives users points for every purchase made, as well as rewards and discounts for those who make a ton of purchases through the app.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/?attachment_id=653171" rel="attachment wp-att-653171"></a>So how does it work on the back end? For now, Chan and team are actually just buying items at local vendors, packaging and shipping items themselves. That means users don&#8217;t have to worry about building a shopping cart or bundling items together &#8212; since PayDragon is taking care of fulfillment, it&#8217;ll package items together itself.</p>
<p>While the checkout feature has been added to the app, PayDragon will keep its legacy &#8220;Takeout&#8221; feature, allowing users to buy food from participating restaurants &#8212; but it&#8217;s clear that&#8217;s no longer the focus of the app. The PayDragon team clearly hopes to boost mobile commerce capabilities by making it drop-dead simple, so that users don&#8217;t actually have to go anywhere or do anything to get the items they want.</p>
<p>PayDragon has <a target="_blank" href="http://pandodaily.com/2012/07/27/paydragon-raises-1-35-million-so-hungry-people-can-skip-lines/">raised $1.35 million in seed funding</a> from Rustic Canyon Partners, SV Angel, Yuri Milner, and Mark Schwartz. </p>
