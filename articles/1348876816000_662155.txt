When you think about Detroit, you don&#8217;t often think first about the technology industry; you think about automobiles. But the reality is that nowadays, the two industries are more intertwined than ever. Indeed, it&#8217;s becoming increasingly apparent that, as Marc Andreessen <a target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460.html">likes to say</a>, &#8220;software is eating the world&#8221; and becoming more central to the future of many traditionally non-techie companies. </p>
<p>Ford Motors is no exception to this trend. Ford&#8217;s CTO <a target="_blank" href="http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=17257">Paul Mascarenas</a> was in San Francisco recently, so we were pleased that he took some time to swing by TechCrunch&#8217;s offices and talk a bit more about what&#8217;s happening on the tech side at Ford and what his job is like on a day-to-day basis. </p>
<p>Watch the video embedded above to hear about why Mascarenas has been spending more and more time in Silicon Valley, how consumer electronics and automotive electronics are coming to a point of &#8220;convergence,&#8221; what Ford&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Sync">close partnership with Microsoft</a> means for the its rep among Apple fans, what he looks for in engineering hires, and more.</p>
