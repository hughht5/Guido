Office 365 University will cost just $79.99 for a four-year subscription and will give students access to all the standard Office products, including <a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/en/word-2013-preview">Word</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/en/powerpoint-2013-preview">PowerPoint</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/en/excel-2013-preview">Excel</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/en/onenote-2013-preview">OneNote</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/en/outlook-2013-preview">Outlook</a>, Publisher and Access.</p>
<p>The University edition will also be available to Â faculty and staff. Students who need more than 4 years of access can renew once for a total of eight years of access (it&#8217;s unclear if faculty will be able to renew more than once).</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/?attachment_id=678755" rel="attachment wp-att-678755"></a>Office 365 University will be available int he first quarter of 2013. As Microsoft notes, however, eligible students can now &#8220;buy Office University 2010 or Office University for Mac 2011 and receive a free subscription to Office 365 University when it becomes available.&#8221;</p>
<p>Office 365 University will also include all of the standard Office 365 subscription features, including 20 GB of extra SkyDrive storage (for a total of 27 GB), 60 minutes of free international Skype calls. While the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/en/office-365-home-premium">Office 365 Home Premium</a> edition can be installed on up to 5 computers, the University edition is limited to two computers (PC or Mac).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no surprise that Microsoft is putting the emphasis on subscriptions with this new service. While Microsoft will continue to offer shrink-wrapped and downloadable versions of its Office suite, the company&#8217;s real focus seems to be on the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/16/ms-office-subscriptions-365/">Office 365 subscription service</a> (and Office as a &#8216;service&#8217; in general). Microsoft&#8217;s basic Home Premium subscription for Office 365, it is worth noting, costs about <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.office.com/b/office-news/archive/2012/09/17/the-new-office-365-subscriptions-for-consumers-and-small-businesses.aspx">$100 per year</a>.</p>
