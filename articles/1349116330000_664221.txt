Clicking on the Ping link in the iTunes sidebar now returns an error, if it even still appears there. Our own Josh Constine <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/ping-facebook/">foretold its demise</a> back in September, and now it&#8217;s gone, both on mobile and the desktop.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing about Ping: it probably won&#8217;t be missed. The social networking effort from Apple got off to a rough start, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/03/problem-ping/">amid problems with Facebook integration</a>, and it didn&#8217;t get much better from there. There was hope it would be revived thanks to some social help from Twitter, but that didn&#8217;t come to pass. People just didn&#8217;t seem interested in participating in a social network that lived only inside of iTunes itself, and that essentially operated as a thinly veiled promotional machine for iTunes music content.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not surprising that it&#8217;s gone, only that it took this long, really.</p>
