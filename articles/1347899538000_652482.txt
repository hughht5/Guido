Besides Snapseed, though, the company also offers numerous other <a target="_blank" href="http://www.niksoftware.com/products/usa/entry.php">tools</a> for amateur and professional photographers. The Nik Software team says that it has always &#8220;aspired to share [its] passion for photography with everyone&#8221; and that &#8220;with Google&#8217;s support [the Nik Software team] hopes to be able to help many millions more people create awesome pictures. Neither Nik Software nor Google have disclosed the financial terms of the transaction.</p>

<p>Here is what Vic Gundotra had to say about the acquisition:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today Iâ€™m excited to welcome +<a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/105020366195257635597">Nik Software</a> to the Google family! We want to help our users create photos they absolutely love, and in our experience Nik does this better than anyone.</p></blockquote>
<p>Snapseed is, at its core, very similar to Instagram and allows users to apply filters and perform other photo editing tasks on their mobile devices and on the desktop. Snapseed won Apple&#8217;s iPad App of the Year award in 2011 and the company <a target="_blank" href="http://img.us.download.niksoftware.com.s3.amazonaws.com/Snapseed_Presskit/Snapseed_Birthday_Press_Release_v4_US_website.pdf">says</a> that the application has more than 9 million users. The Snapseed team was already working on an Android app, too, which probably made the company an even more attractive acquisition target for Google.</p>
<p>Nik Software was founded in 1995 and has offices in Hamburg, Germany, and San Diego. The company received a minority equity investment from Nikon Corporation Japan in 2005.</p>
