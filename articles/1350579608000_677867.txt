To address this problem, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zappli.com/">Zappli</a>, makers of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.myshopanion.com/">myShopanion</a> iOS application, have publicly launched &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.instabuy.co/">instaBuy</a>.&#8221; Similar to Amazon&#8217;s one-click checkout (but back off, patent lawyers, it&#8217;s got two clicks!), the feature allows mobile shoppers to provide their content info, billing address and credit card details just one time, then tap a button to buy from that point forward. After tapping, shoppers still have to enter in a password to verify the purchase, but it&#8217;s still a far easier solution than actually stepping through the traditional checkout experience.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/?attachment_id=677905" rel="attachment wp-att-677905"></a>The feature is live now in the company&#8217;s comparison shopping app called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.instabuy.co/">myShopanion</a>, which offers mobile access to the stores from a couple of dozen retailers, including Walmart, Buy.com, Kohl&#8217;s, Macy&#8217;s, Best Buy, Barnes &amp; Noble, and others. In addition to the streamlined checkout, the company also built technology that lets you view the product options (think available colors, clothing sizes, etc.) in a mobile format, even if the retailer doesn&#8217;t offer a mobile-friendly website. Co-founder and CEO Phillipe Suchet declined to give details as to what the turnaround time was for making those types of integrations possible, but claims it takes &#8220;very little time&#8221; to implement on their end.</p>
<p>But what&#8217;s more interesting, perhaps, is that the instaBuy feature is also being made available to third-parties, which they can implement in their own mobile website or app by adding a line of code. Suchet says there are some deals in the works regarding this now, but he can&#8217;t disclose the names yet. From the sounds of it, though, the first adopters outside of myShopanion will be price comparison engines and mobile shopping malls, not individual retailers.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t those companies compete with myShopanion? Yes, but Suchet says that the myShopanion app serves as a great testing ground. &#8220;This becomes a way to have a pretty amazing laboratory where we can improve what we do,&#8221; he explains. The app works on the affiliate model, but he declined to offer numbers for active users, downloads, or any other metrics.</p>
<p>In addition to supporting mobile, the plan is to take instaBuy to the web next.</p>
