Today it&#8217;s adding to that with a Windows 8 version. The free app is being featured on the Windows Store and is &#8211; the company claims &#8211; the first app with built in free-text search. That means users can enter &#8220;Flights to Berlin next Tuesday, back a week later&#8221;, rather than completing several data fields, to search for flights. Users can also pin and track flight searches to their Windows desktop through live tiles. Skyscanner&#8217;s app also runs on iPhone, iPad, Android, Windows Phone and BlackBerry.</p>
<p>In a separate announcement, the company said it planned to create 100 new jobs in Scotland, in its Edinburgh HQ, with a new Glasgow office planned for 2013. Given that 70% of Skyscanner’s income is now generated outside the UK, they now need more people to deal with the incoming.</p>
<p>Gareth Williams, co-founder and CEO, says they plan to be &#8220;the world’s number one travel search site over the next few years&#8221; and are happy with Edinburgh&#8217;s development as a leading tech hub in the UK. Right now Skyscanner has 150 staff in Edinburgh, with 20 employees based in Singapore and in its Beijing office, which opened last month. </p>
<p>Available in more than 30 languages, Skyscanner says that its mobile apps account for about a third of the 30 million monthly visits to its site, an in Asia it accounts for more than 50 percent. It&#8217;s also <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scotsman.com/scotland-on-sunday/business/skyscanner-flying-high-as-it-hits-ten-million-app-download-milestone-1-2529485">looking at </a> integrating its flight search technology with the rail systems of emerging markets.</p>
<p>Founded in 2003, Skyscanner is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scotsman.com/scotland-on-sunday/business/skyscanner-flying-high-as-it-hits-ten-million-app-download-milestone-1-2529485">reportedly</a> on track to achieve an annual turnover of close to £30m, nearing £10m in profit. That&#8217;s likely been bouyed by a recent <a target="_blank" href="http://www.skyscanner.net/news/articles/2012/08/013418-skyscanner-announces-partnership-with-chinas-number-one-search-engine.html">partnership</a> it signed with the Chinese search engine Baidu.</p>
