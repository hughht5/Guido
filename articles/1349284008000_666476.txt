It will cost $7 per post and Facebook hopes it will be used for garage sales, parties, wedding photos and other important announcements. Promoted Posts has already been rolled out to 20 other countries, and is available to people with less than 5000 total friends and subscribers.</p>
<p>Promoted Posts could help surface important announcements and earn Facebook money. However, I worry that Promoted Posts could <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/10/highlight-facebook-status-updates/">change the atmosphere of Facebook </a>from one where the most beloved content get seen most to one where the rich can dominate the news feed.</p>
<p>Facebook first began testing the product, then called Highlight, in May in New Zealand. After you publish a post, a Promote button will let you pay to bump up its rank in the news feed &#8212; making it appear both higher in the feed, and to a larger portion of your friends. Unpromoted posts are typically only seen by 12-16% of your friends.</p>
