It&#8217;s a change that means users get access to an improved browsing experience, more content on menu screens visible at once, and also fullscreen playback of videos in 16:9 format, instead of presenting them letterboxed.</p>
<p>This is probably an update that many Netflix users who upgraded to iPhone 5 were probably looking forward to, as one of the main advantages of the screen changes on the device comes with making it better for viewing movies and other video content.</p>
<p>Netflix also touts an improved overall experience, which changes to browsing and searching as well as video viewing. This is a must-have update for anyone who&#8217;s looking to get the most out of their iPhone 5.</p>
