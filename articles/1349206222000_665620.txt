It acts like a traditional App Store. After the reviewing process, apps are available to purchase in a centralized store. Users can choose where to install their apps in the latest Steam beta. However, like Amazon&#8217;s Appstore for Android, Valve can discount apps if it thinks that it would benefit the customer and the developer.</p>
<p>Right now, only <a target="_blank" href="http://store.steampowered.com/software/">a handful of apps</a> are available. It was important for Valve to open the store before the release of Windows 8 to minimize the vendor lockin effect.</p>
<p>Graphic apps and pro softwares are currently dominating the selection, with ArtRage Studio Pro, 3D-Coat and 3DMark benchmarking softwares already available. It might be a sign that Valve is focusing on high-end, niche applications instead of cheap, single purpose apps.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if Steam&#8217;s usual process to accept new games will be a good fit for the software industry. Steam benefits from a very geeky userbase who already have their credit cards registered in the system. More than 5 million users launch Steam everyday. Tapping into that attention span to sell software could help the launch of the new offering.</p>
<p>Apps will have to coexist with games in the main listings, which is reminiscent of the iTunes Store homepage in iTunes. But there is a <a target="_blank" href="http://store.steampowered.com/software/">separate Software tab</a> as well.</p>
