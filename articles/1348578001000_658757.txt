<p>As we&#8217;ve written in the past, Punchbowl&#8217;s platform allows users to create <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/04/punchbowl-debuts-digital-invitation-studio-invites/">beautiful online invitations</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/12/party-planning-platform-punchbowl-expands-beyond-invitations-to-digital-greeting-cards/">stationary</a> and track RSVPs. The startup also provides tools that let you organize an after party and even set a date, via an algorithm that recommends the best date for your party, set up gift registries, save-the-dates, message boards, add <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/11/punchbowl-amazon-mothers-day/">gift cards,</a> integrate Google Maps’ to display the location, and share comments, photos, and videos. Punchbowl previously allowed you to find supplies, but didn&#8217;t have its own dedicated e-commerce site for party supplies.</p>
<p>Shopping Aisle basically will suggest items for you based on data from the invitations you create, including event type, date, location, number of guests, age and gender. The retail site offers adult, child, and pet costumes and accessories for Halloween, and party supplies and decorations for Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and birthdays.</p>
<p>Providing a personalized approach was important to the user experience, explains Matt Douglas, the company&#8217;s founder and CEO. It&#8217;s more than just recommending supplies based on holidays, he says. For example, if you are having a princess-themed party for your child, Punchbowl would recommend princess-themed favors, cups, bowls, decorations and more.</p>
<p>TechCrunch readers will get free shipping on any party supply order until the end of the day Wednesday using this code &#8220;TC9NV2&#8243; at checkout.</p>
