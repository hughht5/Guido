It makes working credit of up to £20,000 available instantly to eBay and Amazon Marketplace sellers through automated underwriting. In this space there is <a target="_blank" href="http://Iwoca.co.uk">Iwoca</a> in the UK, but they only cater to ebay sellers. Ezbob covers both eBay and Amazon, a more more difficult &#8216;nut&#8217; to crack. In the US, Ezbob would be similar to <a target="_blank" href="http://Kabbage.com">Kabbage</a>, which has yet to scale internationally.</p>
<p>Founded by two Israeli entrepreneurs in 2011, Ezbob is the trading name of Orange Money, a privately-held UK company, which received angel funding last year and recently completed its Series A funding round. In the seed round, Ezbob raised £450,000 from Extreme Credit Systems. The Series A round raised £1.5 million from Keren Hagshama and £500,000 from high net worth individuals.</p>
<p>CEO and Co-founder, Tomer Guriel says Ezbob is aimed at small e-retailers typically with under £1 million in annual turnover, for whom securing funding from traditional sources can be challenging. According to IMRG (Interactive Media in Retail Group) UK e-retail sales in 2012 are estimated to reach £77billion, and e-retail now accounts for 17 per cent of the total UK retail market.</p>
