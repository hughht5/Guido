<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/samsungsmallinvite.jpeg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="samsungsmallinvite" title="samsungsmallinvite" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>A good chunk of Samsung&#8217;s recent smartphone releases seemed intent on stretching people&#8217;s hands beyond their limits, but it seems like the company may be ready to buck that trend very soon. According to a recently released press invitation, Samsung will be pulling back the curtains on a smaller-than-usual smartphone at its Mobile Store in Frankfurt on October 11.</p>
<p>&#8220;So big can be small,&#8221; the invitation reads. &#8220;And so small can be big.&#8221; Cryptic, no?</p>
<p>Anyway, more than a few people have latched onto the idea that this mystery smartphone is in fact a tinier, more pocketable version of Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy S III. German gadget site<a target="_blank" href="http://www.mobiflip.de/kommt-das-galaxy-s3-mini-zum-samsung-mobile-presseevent-am-11-oktober/"> MobiFlip</a> (who first published the images of the interview) claims that anything other than a miniature Galaxy S III wouldn&#8217;t make sense at this point, an assertion that happens to jibe nicely with earlier whispers of a tiny Galaxy S III. Alright, maybe &#8220;tiny&#8221; isn&#8217;t the right word &#8212; the GSIII Mini&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sammobile.com/2012/09/30/t-mobile-tas-systems-confirms-galaxy-s-ii-plus-and-galaxy-s-iii-mini/">purported spec sheet</a> pegs it as having a 4-inch Super AMOLED panel and a 5-megapixel camera, in addition to running the &#8220;latest&#8221; version of Android.</p>
<p>The rest of the image doesn&#8217;t really give us much to work more with &#8212; as with most event invitations, it seems to revel in its vagueness &#8212; but there&#8217;s a conspicuous S logo nestled behind the text that indicates that whatever we&#8217;re going to see is part of Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy S family. That&#8217;s actually an important distinction to make here too, because the company is more than happy to push out lower-end and niche devices under the Galaxy banner, but the S line has been the company&#8217;s flagship line of Android handsets for years now, so whatever happens to take the proverbial stage next week should be worth keeping an eye on.</p>
