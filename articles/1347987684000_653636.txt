This will enable BlackBerry devices to handle files larger 4GB in size.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exfat">exFAT</a> (Extended File Allocation Table) was designed by Microsoft specifically for flash drives, including memory sticks and SD cards. It offers compatibility between flash drives and the file systems found on Windows and OSX. However, <a target="_blank" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/fa.linux.kernel/kD6xghJ-jyE">there is no Linux support</a>.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/08/08/microsoft_samsung_exfat/">According to The Register</a> other companies that have licensed the technology include Sharp, Panasonic, SANYO, Sony and Canon. </p>
<p>Microsoft and RIM have become classic &#8220;frenemies.&#8221; Windows Phone 7 competes directly with BlackBerry, and last year Microsoft <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsoft-readies-tool-for-managing-ipads-iphones-and-android-devices/8987">announced</a> that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/system-center/configuration-manager-2012.aspx">System Center 2012 Configuration Manager</a> would have device management features that compete with the BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES). But Redmond has also <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsoft-rim-expected-to-unveil-new-free-hosted-blackberry-service/8939">partnered with Waterloo to bring BES to Office 365</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier today RIM <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/18/rim-to-shut-down-tungle-me-team-will-focus-on-blackberry-10-calendar-app/">announced that it is shutting down the popular calendaring service Tungle</a>, which it acquired last year, to build a BlackBerry-only app, much to the chagrin of its users.</p>
