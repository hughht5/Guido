Financial terms were not disclosed.</p>
<p>Butterfly&#8217;s main feature is its ability to migrate data center infrastructures. According to the company website, it focuses on lowering the cost and risk of maintaining legacy storage and backup &amp; recovery environments. This allows companies to consolidate enterprise data and analyze it for strategic purposes.</p>
<p>IBM has staked its claim in the analytics market. This acquisition plays to that strategy.</p>
<p>The news follows IBM&#8217;s$1.3 billion acquisition last month of Kenexa, which helps companies cull vast amounts of data to make decisions and study trends.</p>
<p>IBM plans to continue its acquisition strategy for analytics companies. Its goal is to generate $16 billion from business analytics by 2015.</p>
<p>Another play here is for IBM to provide deeper capabilities it can offer in the storage market. Backup is a bear for companies and analysis will be increasingly important as companies store an increasing amount of data.</p>
