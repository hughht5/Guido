Maxwell, a former Apple and Smule employee, said Zynga workers were apparently given just two hours to clean out their desks.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re awaiting a response from our contacts at Zynga, and will have more details soon.</p>
<p>Maxwell says friends from Zynga were included in the layoffs, and that&#8217;s where he learned the news from. Zynga employees themselves may be forbidden from talking about their exit.</p>
<p>The layoffs follow a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/05/more-competitors-smarter-gamers-expensive-ads-less-virality-mobile/">tough couple months for Zynga</a>, as it has struggled to keep its share price afloat as executives leave (or are fired for not performing) and revenue trouble continues.</p>

<p>Neither of the games whose teams apparently experienced layoffs have been performing especially well this month, according to AppData. <a target="_blank" href="http://appdata.com/apps/facebook/104707979641590-the-ville">TheVille has been bleeding users</a>, down from 26.2 million monthly active users to just 17.5 million in the last month. Meanwhile <a target="_blank" href="http://appdata.com/apps/facebook/140411086031060-zynga-bingo">Zynga Bingo</a> drifted down from 5.8 million to 5.4 million monthly users in the last 30 days.</p>
