<p>We&#8217;re awaiting a response from our contacts at Zynga, and will have more details soon.</p>
<p>Maxwell is a former Apple, Sony, Mint, and Smule employee. He said Zynga workers were apparently given just two hours to clean out their desks. He apparently learned the news straight from friends at Zynga who were included in the layoffs, and that&#8217;s where he learned the news from. Zynga employees themselves may be forbidden from talking about their exit.</p>

<p>Our sources have a few more juicy tidbits. One Zynga employee says there are still about 1/3 of the workers still around the Austin office, so it doesn&#8217;t appear to be a total office shutdown. We hear mobile teams may be safe, as Zynga sees the small screen as the future of its business. The San Francisco headquarter may also be safe from layoffs.</p>
<p>Earlier this month Zynga&#8217;s share price plummeted after it <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/04/zynga-after-hours/">reduced earnings and revenue projections</a> for the coming year. At the time CEO Mark Pincus said there would be &#8220;targeted cost reductions&#8221; in many areas aka layoffs. So while the pink slips may have been expected, their announcement during the Apple iPad Mini event most of the tech world was watching makes it seem like Zynga was trying to minimize the fallout of the cuts. That clearly didn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>Neither of the games whose teams apparently experienced layoffs have been performing especially well this month, according to AppData. <a target="_blank" href="http://appdata.com/apps/facebook/104707979641590-the-ville">TheVille has been bleeding users</a>, down from 26.2 million monthly active users to just 17.5 million in the last month. Meanwhile <a target="_blank" href="http://appdata.com/apps/facebook/140411086031060-zynga-bingo">Zynga Bingo</a> drifted down from 5.8 million to 5.4 million monthly users in the last 30 days.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The layoffs follow a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/05/more-competitors-smarter-gamers-expensive-ads-less-virality-mobile/">tough couple months for Zynga</a>, as it has struggled to keep its share price afloat as executives leave (or are fired for not performing) and revenue trouble continues. It&#8217;s also had to deal with <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/09/working-at-zynga/">harsh criticism of its company culture</a> by former employees.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s still hope for the company if it can find a way to inspire remaining employees to stay and fulfill the company&#8217;s mission of connecting the world through games. But Zynga is running out of extra lives and could end up bought out and dismantled or have to further slash its roster.</p>
