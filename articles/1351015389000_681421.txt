<p>Possibly trying to hide the grim news by announcing it during Apple&#8217;s event, Zynga just laid off over 100 employees from its Bingo and TheVille teams in its Austin office, according to <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/303/status/260801024732827649">Justin Maxwell</a>, a former Apple and Smule employees. Zynga workers were apparently given just two hours to clean out their desks. We&#8217;re awaiting a response from our contacts at Zynga, and will have more details soon.</p>
