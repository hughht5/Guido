This upgraded model is more akin to the original Nano design with a longer screen and physical home button. The device is far smaller than you&#8217;d expect, and it&#8217;s mostly glass and aluminum with a bit of plastic to hold it together.</p>
<p>The UI is very similar to the old Nano&#8217;s stripped-down iOS except that functionality appears in little icons arrayed on the screen. The standard functions are still there &#8211; music player, FM radio, sports apps &#8211; but this one also plays back video and photos.</p>
<p>The Nano is, to be clear, the runt of the iPod/iPhone litter. It&#8217;s quite inexpensive, and the screen is far less interesting than anything else in the line. It&#8217;s great for casual use, and parents may consider it now as a good option for kids. While I still like the previous Nano for its size, this upgrade adds a bit more of the media features we&#8217;ve come to expect from iPods.</p>
<p>The Nano will be available in October for $149. It has a 16GB capacity.</p>
