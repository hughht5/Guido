The peddlers of so-called &#8220;scareware&#8221; are facing a $163 million fine for  misrepresenting &#8221;expressly or by implication, that they had conducted scans of consumers’ computers and detected security or privacy issues, including viruses, spyware, system errors, and pornography.&#8221; Users who surf the internet enough will recognize scareware advertisements as the ones pretending to have found malicious content on their computer and then, conveniently, offer an expensive solution ($30-$100) to fix it.</p>
<p>Scareware crime bosses, Kristy Ross, Sam Jain, Daniel Sundin will jointly share the lion share of the fine, which is nearly triple the amount ($60M) the team took in from 2000 to 2008. The full opinion can be read here [<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/caselist/0723137/121002winfixeropinion.pdf">PDF</a>]. The lesson here is don&#8217;t be a jerk: the government will, rightly so, bring on the pain.</p>
