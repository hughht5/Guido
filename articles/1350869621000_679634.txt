Their secret is consistently pushing forward in terms of modern design as well as technical innovation. Their new UR-210 timepiece might look like a spaceship, but is really just a gadget to tell you that it is time to get off your butt and exercise. It is nevertheless beautiful, and precision-made.</p>
<p>Automatic mechanical watches are wound by the rotation of a weighted rotor which is meant to move with the motion of your wrist. This motion is used to wind a mainspring. Watches with power reserve indicators like the UR-210 tell you how much power is left in the movement. Urwerk added a novel feature connected to the power reserve indicator called a winding efficiency indicator. Purely mechanical, this tool measures the amount of power you&#8217;ve generated for the watch over the last two hours. If you aren&#8217;t moving around enough (and thus not generating power), the winding efficiencyindicator goes into the red zone. If you are shaking fists all daylong you&#8217;ll be in the green zone.</p>
<p>Urwerk considers this new function to be a novel way for the owner to connect with their watch. Like most Urwerk timepieces, the time is told via a special satellite arm system which looks incredibly cool. It is a fantastically elaborate new timepiece with a complication you might grow to love or hate.</p>
