Some artists making over $100K a year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of the rumor that artists only make $15 a year from streaming services, Westergren said, &#8220;that&#8217;s far, far from the truth.&#8221; Pandora will release a blog post of data on artist earnings soon but gave the SF MusicTech Summit crowd a preview, noting &#8220;You&#8217;d be surprised by how many artists are making more than the average [US] household income just from Pandora.&#8221;</p>
<p>[<strong>Update</strong>: Pandora has <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.pandora.com/pandora/archives/2012/10/pandora-and-art.html">published this blog post</a> noting that over 2,000 artists will earn over $10,000 in the next year from Pandora. Over 800 will earn more $50,000, and artists like Coldplay, Adele, Wiz Khalifa, and Jason Aldean will earn over $1 million each. Finally, extremely popular artists Drake and Lil Wayne are nearing a $3 million annual rate each.]</p>
<p>He said that Pandora accounts for 6.53 percent of U.S. radio listening, but &#8220;imagine if it was 30 percent, 40 percent, 50 percent? We&#8217;re talking about making a living.&#8221; I asked Westergren whether Spotify&#8217;s free radio service has had any negative impact on Pandora, and he bluntly responded, &#8220;we haven&#8217;t seen any impact on growth from anything launched in the last five years.&#8221; Westergren followed with a clear explanation of Spotify&#8217;s economic troubles. PrivcCo stats <a target="_blank" href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/10/05/the-royalty-squeeze-spotify-booked-a-59m-net-loss-in-2011-on-244m-in-revenue/">reported by The Next Web</a>and confirmed by Spotify indicate that while revenue grew 151 percent to $244.5 million from 2010 to 2011, its net losses went up 60 percent to roughly $59 million.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">&#8220;Anyone who plays in the radio space has to reckon with the same thing we reckon with, and you know, it&#8217;s tough. To become an effective seller of advertising you have to be large. The &#8216;getting to large&#8217; phase is really expensive, because every additional listening hour comes with a royalty payment, but you&#8217;re not that good at advertising so you burn a lot of money. It&#8217;s hard to get over the hump.&#8221;<em></em></p>
<p>He maintained a confident, defiant tone when I asked if Spotify&#8217;s radio service worried Pandora in the long-term. &#8220;The only thing that&#8217;s worrying me is the royalty situation in Washington.&#8221; For his company, and for the benefit of innovation in general, he urged for more reasonable royalty rates to be applied to online radio. &#8220;We want the same standard extended to web radio that currently is being applied to our competitors [satellite radio, cable radio],&#8221; pleaded Westergren. After his talk, I asked what the specific impact of high royalty rates was on companies trying to build the future of music listening. Westergren said that:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;A company like ours has a mainstay product like radio [but Pandora also wants to create things that aid] artist to fan connection and local music activation. There&#8217;s a big pipeline of features that just sit there because they can&#8217;t get prioritized above immediate revenue generators. We have a wall literally covered with ideas that have an engineering cost, and they each get pulled off until the three about optimizing advertising are the only ones left&#8221;.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Westergren also denied that his quest to reduce the per-song royalty rates that Pandora pays is fundamentally anti-artist. He said that lower fees would leave more resources to dedicate to building better services. That could increase listening as a whole, thereby earning artists more even if they get paid less per song.</p>
