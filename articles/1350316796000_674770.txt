The company has acquired a minority stake in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ebuddy.com">eBuddy</a>, an Amsterdam, Netherlands-based startup that focuses on enabling multi-client chat on the web and mobile.</p>
<p>The deal was first reported today by the Dutch web news site <a target="_blank" href="http://www.emerce.nl/nieuws/japanse-gamesgigant-gree-neemt-strategisch-belang-ebuddy">Emerce</a>, which picked up on new data from the Amsterdam Chamber of Commerce that showed eBuddy&#8217;s board has changed since August to include Taisei Yoshida en Ryotaro Shima, two GREE executives. </p>
<p>When reached via email by TechCrunch, eBuddy co-founder Jan-Joost Rueb said that his company has indeed sold a stake to GREE, and that the Japanese company now holds two out of five board seats. Last year, eBuddy was <a target="_blank" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ebuddy-2011-8">reportedly</a> shopping around a twenty percent at a total valuation of $100 million, which seems to line up with this deal. Rueb said he was not entitled to &#8220;confirm or deny&#8221; those rumors, writing: &#8220;All I can confirm it is a strategic minority investment.&#8221; </p>
<p>At the moment, eBuddy, which was <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ebuddy.com/about.html">founded in 2003</a> as e-Messenger, has 85 full-time employees and boasts 300 million IM users in its database. GREE, meanwhile, has global revenues of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/16/gree-international/">$2 billion annually</a>.</p>
