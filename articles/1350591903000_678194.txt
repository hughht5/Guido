The announcement is being made on-stage at the New York Public Library, where Twitter&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/magicandrew">Andrew Fitzgerald</a> is on-stage with the New Yorker&#8217;s fiction editor Deborah Treisman.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve reached out to Twitter for more details, but there&#8217;s already some <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/07/plympton-kickstarter-amazon/">basic info</a> posted by <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/07/plympton-kickstarter-amazon/">serialized fiction startup Plympton</a>, which will be participating in the festival. Somewhere between 12 and 20 authors will be selected, with an application going up up on the Twitter site soon. You don&#8217;t have to be a published author to apply.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure about the exact details of what the authors will be doing, but it sounds like they&#8217;ll will be posting their fiction on Twitter, essentially serializing their their pieces one tweet at a time. If that sounds a little nuts, recall that the New Yorker actually experimented with this back in May, when it <a target="_blank" href="https://dev.twitter.com/media/twitter-moments/authors/jennifer-egan-black-box">tweeted Jennifer Egan&#8217;s story &#8220;Black Box&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll update this post with officials details once I have them. You can also follow the tweets from the event through <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/search?q=%23twitterfiction&amp;src=hash">the #twitterfiction hashtag</a>.</p>
