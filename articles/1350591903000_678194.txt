The announcement is being made on-stage at the New York Public Library, where Twitter&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/magicandrew">Andrew Fitzgerald</a> is on-stage with the New Yorker&#8217;s fiction editor Deborah Treisman, and there are now details <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.twitter.com/2012/10/announcing-twitter-fiction-festival.html">on the Twitter blog</a>.</p>
<p>The company says that it will be looking for &#8220;creative experiments in storytelling from authors around the world.&#8221; That might include &#8220;short story in Tweets, a Twitter chat, live-tweeting,&#8221; or something entirely new.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re having a hard time imagining what fiction looks like on Twitter, or if you just think it&#8217;s a horrible idea, recall that the New Yorker actually experimented with this back in May, when it <a target="_blank" href="https://dev.twitter.com/media/twitter-moments/authors/jennifer-egan-black-box">tweeted Jennifer Egan&#8217;s story &#8220;Black Box&#8221;</a>. (The company blog post has a few other examples of how authors have used Twitter.)</p>
<p>According to some <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/07/plympton-kickstarter-amazon/">a blog post</a> from <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/07/plympton-kickstarter-amazon/">serialized fiction startup Plympton</a> (which will be participating in the festival). between 12 and 20 authors will be selected. </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in participating, <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/a/twitter.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dHRSMkxKRWRmQmpWR1V1QkRoTlRSQnc6MQ">you can apply here</a>.</p>
