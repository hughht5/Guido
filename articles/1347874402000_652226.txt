Every time Apple launches a new iPhone or iPhone(S), it seems that the Internet is about to explode. Naturally, when the iPhone 5 was announced, many were curious to see if the launch would yet again exceed expectations or if eye-rolling and &#8220;mehs&#8221; would win the day.</p>
<p>Just in case there was any skepticism, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/att-sets-sales-record-for-iphone-5-2012-09-17">this morning AT&amp;T confirmed</a> just how significant the demand is for the iPhone 5, calling it the &#8220;most successful iPhone launch ever.&#8221; AT&amp;T said in a press release this morning that it set a sales record over the weekend, making it the &#8220;fastest-selling iPhone&#8221; the company has offered to date.</p>
<p>Already, customers have apparently ordered more iPhone 5s in its first weekend of availability &#8220;than any previous model.&#8221; Hot cakes indeed.</p>
<p>Pre-orders for the iPhone 5 went on sale at midnight (PST) last Friday. Within an hour, Apple sold out of its pre-order stock, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/14/iphone-5-pre-order-sells-out-20x-faster-than-4-and-4s-further-highlighting-apples-dominance/">as Billy wrote at the time</a>. What&#8217;s more, customer demand in the first hour caused brief outages on Apple.com as well as on carrier websites.</p>
<p>Comparatively, the iPhone 4S took 22 hours to sell out, while the iPhone 4 sold out of pre-orders in 20 hours. While that would be considered a categorical success by most standards, the iPhone 5 sold out nearly 20-times faster than the 4 and 4S. The demand for the iPhone caused Apple to adjust its shipping expectations from one to two weeks on Friday, which has since increased to between two to three weeks.</p>
<p>Apparently, the demand for the iPhone 5 has been so great that it even caught Apple by surprise. Apple spokeswoman <a target="_blank" href="http://allthingsd.com/20120914/apple-on-iphone-5-pre-orders-weve-been-completely-blown-away/">Nat Kerris told AllThingsD</a> on Friday that pre-order demand for the iPhone 5 has &#8220;been incredible&#8221; and that the company has been &#8220;completely blown away by the customer response.&#8221; Obviously, Apple would say that, but AT&amp;T&#8217;s announcement this morning makes it impossible to ignore the fact that the iPhone 5 is shaping up to catapult Apple into the stratosphere. Again? Again. Ugh.</p>
<p>While, historically, many have been unhappy with spotty coverage and service on AT&amp;T iPhones, being the first carrier to support the iPhone when it first launched in 2007 &#8212; and its continued support since &#8212; has obviously been a huge boon for AT&amp;T. The iPhone 5 looks to continue that, and it will be interesting to see if the carrier struggles to keep up with and support the influx of new users.</p>
<p>However, one thing that is conspicuously missing from AT&amp;T&#8217;s announcement this morning &#8230; numbers. AT&amp;T has not (as of yet) released any numbers or statistics on how many orders it received over the weekend, which would significantly help substantiate its claim that this is the most. successful launch. EVAR.</p>
<p>Hopefully those numbers are forthcoming, and we&#8217;ll update as soon as we learn more.</p>
