Every time Apple launches a new iPhone or iPhone(S), it seems that the Internet is about to explode. Naturally, when the iPhone 5 was announced, many were curious to see if the launch would yet again exceed expectations or if eye-rolling and &#8220;mehs&#8221; would win the day.</p>
<p>Well, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/14/iphone-5-pre-order-sells-out-20x-faster-than-4-and-4s-further-highlighting-apples-dominance/">as Billy shared on Friday</a>, the launch of the iPhone 5 has been anything but a dud. So far. Pre-orders went on sale at midnight last Friday and, within an hour, they were sold out &#8212; with customer demand causing brief outages both on Apple.com as well as carrier websites.</p>
<p>Just in case there was any skepticism, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/att-sets-sales-record-for-iphone-5-2012-09-17">this morning AT&amp;T confirmed</a> just how significant the demand is for the iPhone 5, calling it the &#8220;most successful iPhone launch ever.&#8221; AT&amp;T said in a press release this morning that it set a sales record over the weekend, making it the &#8220;fastest-selling iPhone&#8221; the company has offered to date.</p>
