It was a big exit for the company, which sold for a whopping $1.2 billion. CEO and founder of Yammer David Sacks took the stage at TechCrunch Disrupt SF to talk to Mike Arrington about the past, present and future for the network. </p>
<p>Arrington started by asking Sacks about the early history of Yammer and whether or not the company had ever been in serious talks with Salesforce or Twitter over an acquisition. Sacks said that, in fact, while he had been a huge supporter of Twitter early on and has great respect for Marc Benioff (Salesforce&#8217;s CEO), he never shopped Yammer around early on.</p>
