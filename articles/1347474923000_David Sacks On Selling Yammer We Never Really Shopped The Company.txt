It was a big exit for the company, which sold for a whopping $1.2 billion. CEO and founder of Yammer David Sacks took the stage at TechCrunch Disrupt SF to talk to Mike Arrington about the past, present and future for the network. </p>
<p>Arrington started by asking Sacks about the early history of Yammer and whether or not the company had ever been in serious talks with Salesforce or Twitter over an acquisition. Sacks said that, in fact, while he had been a huge supporter of Twitter (and even promoted the idea that someone should buy it when it was at a sub-$100M value) and has great respect for Marc Benioff (Salesforce&#8217;s CEO), he never shopped Yammer around in the early stages of its growth.</p>
<p>This also comes in the context of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/marc-benioff-yammer-should-not-have-sold-the-company-to-microsoft/">yesterday&#8217;s conversation between Mike Arrington and Benioff</a>, in which the Salesforce.com CEO sais that Yammer should not have sold to Microsoft and that, in fact, he had passed on buying the company due to its conflicts with Chatter, Salesforce&#8217;s own activity stream.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t quite sour grapes, though it was tough to tell when Benioff justified his statement by championing the &#8220;stay independent&#8221; philosophy for entrepreneurs, which has certainly worked for Salesforce. &#8220;If everything is going fine, then no need to sell now,&#8221; Benioff said.</p>
<p>Sacks responded to that statement this morning by saying that Yammer is the leader in the enterprise social communications space and continues to push forward. Sacks said that he is still leading the company along with his co-founder Adam Pisoni and plans to be there for the foreseeable future, even though Arrington tried to place a bet with him, in which he would give Sacks a $20 Starbucks gift card if he were still working at Yammer in a year.</p>
