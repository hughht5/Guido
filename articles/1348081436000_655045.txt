<p>Here we go again. Samsung (and its agency) has historically had <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/09/samsung-galaxy-s-ii-ad-both-targets-and-mocks-apple-fanbois/">no problem</a> poking fun at overly-obsessed, iPhone-idolizing Apple fanatics, and just like clockwork, the Korean electronics giant has released a new commercial pointing out a handful of the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/18/iphone-5-review/">iPhone 5’s</a> omissions and foibles.</p>
<p>In case you don’t have a minute and a half to burn, here’s the whole thing in a nutshell: the commercial pokes at Apple’s (perhaps overly earnest) marketing language, the headphone jack’s new location, the new Lightning dock connector (twice!), the lack of NFC, and the general un-coolness of lusting after a smartphone your parents will probably want to own at some point too.</p>
<p>The message is, clearly, that the iPhone 5 just doesn’t match up to Samsung’s flagship Galaxy S III. The accuracy of that point of view is an issue I’ll leave for you to debate, but it&#8217;s a feisty little ad that I think makes a few decent (if completely ham-fisted) points about the perceived feature gap between the two phones. Either way, it&#8217;s hard to resist the temptation (for an ad nerd like me, anyway) to go digging for the commercial&#8217;s potential implications. Is going to put a dent in the iPhone 5&#8242;s sales? Hell no. As usual, people lined up nearly as soon as the damned thing was trotted out in San Francisco, and <a target="_blank" href="http://gdgt.com/apple/iphone/5/">plenty of early reviews</a> point out that the iPhone 5 seems like much more than just the sum of its changelog.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, some people are already reading this commercial as an attempt to reach out to dyed-in-the-wool Apple customers (to see the errors of their ways, I guess). That seems like a hell of a stretch &#8212; after all, the portrayal of Apple line-goers as doe-eyed iPhone apologists probably won’t elicit much in the warm-and-fuzzy feelings department. It seems more like a way to keep the Galaxy S III name at the top of people&#8217;s minds when it comes time to buy a new phone, especially considering that Samsung&#8217;s sizable smartphone will be five or six months old &#8212; nearly ancient in mobile terms &#8212; once the holiday buying frenzy kicks off.</p>
<p>By the way, if you could use a laugh, be sure to check out the video&#8217;s comments <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=nf5-Prx19ZM">on YouTube</a> &#8212; you&#8217;ll surely see platform fanboyism at its finest.</p>
