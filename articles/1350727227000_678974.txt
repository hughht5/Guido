The platform is a hub that connects to the internet and other devices that then senses and controls real-world things like a door lock, or a light or anything else. This is along the lines of the Internet of things we&#8217;ve heard so much about. It previously secured $1.2 million in a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/smartthings/smartthings-make-your-world-smarter/comments?page=2">Kickstarter campaign</a> and has <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/07/kickstarter-hit-instacube-adds-facebook-photo-streaming-in-addition-to-instagram/">announced</a> a partnership with Instacube which will allows the cube to display notifications for things like visitors arriving or leaving the lights on.
