<p>The proliferation of connected screens &#8212; smartphones, tablet,  laptops, TVs, projectors and so on &#8212; means there&#8217;s no shortage of opportunities for sharing digital content from one bit of hardware to another. But with no single, agreed streaming standard, sharing hasn&#8217;t always been as easy as it could be. Miracast aims to reduce the complexity by badging those devices that will stream with each other and also simplifying discoverability and set-up.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the blurb from the Wi-Fi Alliance&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wi-fi.org/media/press-releases/wi-fi-alliance%C2%AE-launch-wi-fi-certified-miracast%E2%84%A2-deliver-display-applications">original release</a> about Miracast:</p>
<blockquote><p>Miracast devices make use of a Wi-Fi connection to deliver audio and video content from one device to another, without cables or a connection to an existing Wi-Fi network. These devices connect directly, so you can do things like watch videos from a smartphone on a big screen television or share a laptop screen with the conference room projector to collaborate in real-time. Televisions, set-top boxes, notebooks, handsets and tablets are among the device types which will be certified.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Wi-Fi Alliance has now opened up the Miracast certification program so device makers can apply to have their kit approved.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wi-Fi users around the world want to experience multimedia on the device of their choice &#8212; no matter what brand &#8212; and Miracast is the breakthrough they have been waiting for,&#8221; said Edgar Figueroa, CEO of Wi-Fi Alliance, in a statement <a target="_blank" href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/easy-to-use-multi-vendor-wireless-display-has-arrived-wi-fi-alliance-launches-wi-fi-certified-miracast-170295746.html">announcing the launch</a>. &#8221;We have been delighted with the level of enthusiasm and support among our member companies for this new offering.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Miracast certified device standard is based on the Wi-Fi Alliance Display Specification &#8212; and builds on another streaming technology, Wi-Fi Direct, by adding &#8220;mechanisms to negotiate video capabilities, setup content protection (if needed), stream content, and maintain the video session&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miracast builds on Wi-Fi Direct with a compelling application,&#8221; noted Brian O&#8217;Rourke from IHS iSuppli Research in a supporting statement. &#8220;This is a big step forward in a market migration from single-vendor display solutions, into an offering from a wide array of vendors.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first consumer products to include Miracast certification since the testing program opened up include the LG Optimus G smartphone, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/19/samsung-galaxy-s-iii-review/">Samsung Galaxy S III</a> smartphone and Samsung Echo-P Series TV. The number of Miracast-certified devices are expected to exceed 1.5 billion in 2016.</p>
<p>Several big name consumer electronics and chip companies have welcomed the Miracast launch &#8212; including Intel, LG, Marvell, Nvidia, Samsung and Sony. But Apple&#8217;s name is of course absent from the supporting comments (see below).</p>
<p>Apple already has its own wireless streaming system &#8212; AirPlay &#8212; which allows content to be streamed between iOS devices and connected TVs via Apple TV. So it&#8217;s a very safe bet to say Cupertino won&#8217;t be stepping outside its walled garden to sign up for Miracast interoperability any time soon.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As a Wi-Fi market leader, Broadcom is honored to be one of the primary certification solutions for the Wi-Fi Alliance Miracast™ program and is committed to driving new Wi-Fi standards,&#8221; said Dino Bekis, Senior Director, Wireless Connectivity Combo Group at <strong>Broadcom</strong>. &#8220;The standardization of this technology will enable consumers to easily and seamlessly share content across the ever-growing landscape of connected devices.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miracast on NVIDIA Tegra will bridge the distance between mobile devices and high-def TVs, providing customers a rich – and cable-free – multimedia experience,&#8221; said Matt Wuebbling, Director of Product Marketing at <strong>NVIDIA</strong>. &#8220;We have embraced Miracast and are working with our OEM partners to bring its amazing possibilities to market.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are happy to have been involved in developing the Miracast program and to be one of the first companies to receive certification,&#8221; said Jessy Chen, Vice President and Spokesman at <strong>Realtek</strong>. &#8220;The solution will greatly expand the market for easy-to-use interoperable wireless display connectivity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As a leader in N-screen technology, Samsung has introduced AllShare Cast (based on Miracast), which is incorporated into most of Samsung&#8217;s high-end smart mobile devices including the GALAXY S III, GALAXY Note 10.1, and GALAXY Note II, &#8221; said Hankil Yoon, Senior Vice President of Product Strategy Team, <strong>Samsung&#8217;s Mobile Communication Business</strong>. &#8220;We will continue to support the program, and plan to offer more Miracast-certified devices to our customers going forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sony Mobile is pleased to support the Wi-Fi CERTIFIED Miracast™ certification program. We continuously strive to deliver new exciting user experiences and Miracast™ technology will enhance our ability to offer consumers seamless connectivity to move their content freely between smartphones and other screens,&#8221; says Nikolaus Scheurer, Director Marketing Planning for <strong>Sony Mobile Communications</strong>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miracast will play an important role in enabling true seamless media streaming, gaming and content sharing between mobile screens and large displays,&#8221; said Ram Machness, director of marketing, Wireless Connectivity Solutions, <strong>Texas Instruments Incorporated</strong>. &#8220;Our OMAP™ platform, DaVinci™ video processors and WiLink™ connectivity products will offer Miracast-certified source and sink solutions to provide a rich experience for our customers&#8217; end products.&#8221;</p>
