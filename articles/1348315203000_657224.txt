These cases, DODOcase calls them <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dodocase.com/collections/durables">Durables</a>, are handmade in San Francisco and is departure from the company&#8217;s traditional products. But they seemingly have the same heart and soul. </p>
<p>Each case is hand sewn using army-khaki canvas, leather and then lined with a poppy orange felt interior. Plus, since they&#8217;re from DODOcase, you can trust that they&#8217;ll last.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been <a href="http://techcrunch.com/tag/dodocase/">a big fan of DODOcase</a> since <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/28/the-ipad-dodocase-wins-our-hearts-and-money/">their first product</a>. The self-named product helped launched an entire category of iPad cases, all designed to hid the iPad (and now other tablets) within a case that looks very much like a book. </p>
<p>This latest line is less of a trailblazer and more of a me-too product, but that shouldn&#8217;t take away from the products themselves. The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dodocase.com/products/wallet-for-iphone-5">iPhone 5 wallet sleeve</a> looks particularly interesting although a bit pricey at $49.95. The large canvas pocket holds the iPhone while handsome leather accents double as pockets for cash and the like. There are plenty of similar cases available, but few come from Bay Area-startups which employ local labor and use top-notch material. </p>
