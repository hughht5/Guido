Well, you&#8217;re not a crazy person. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bnrobotics.com/company/products">Bossa Nova Robotics</a>, makers of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.iloverobots.com">Penbo</a> line of robotic toys, has just launched the mObi [sic], a robot that &#8220;is based on technology that allows the robot to balance on a ball and move seamlessly with a single point of contact on the ground, enabling natural omni-directional movement, slender design profiles and superior navigation in human environments.&#8221;</p>
<p>The robot, shown here, balances on a single ball. Bossa Nova worked with engineers at Carnegie Mellon University to get this girl rolling and apparently it will be available as a research platform first and then as an actual product in around 2013. </p>
<p>We&#8217;re trying to get a bit more information, but until then just imagine how fun it would be to treat this robot like a self-righting punching bag clown and then, when it got angry enough, it would lash out with razor-sharp claws.</p>
