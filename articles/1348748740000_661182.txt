Some of this we&#8217;ve seen before: tactile keyboards that essentially rise up to meet your fingers have long been a theoretically possible addition to screens, and there&#8217;s been talk of Apple using them in the past. But a display that&#8217;s also a built-in surround sound system? That&#8217;s new.</p>
<p>The patent, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.unwiredview.com/2012/09/27/whats-next-for-iphone-flexible-displays-with-tactile-keyboard-laser-mics-and-surround-speakers-built-in/">uncovered by Unwired View</a>, describes displays that could be either concave or convex, allowing for the kind of design Google provided in its <a title="An iPhone Lover's (Initial) Thoughts On iPhone 4" href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/06/08/initial-iphone-4-review/">Nexus S smartphone</a>, but physical changes are just the tip of the iceberg. Moving to a flexible display provided the opportunity to build in tech that leverages it to accomplish some neat tricks, including a keyboard that detects fingers and provides physical resistance to mimic a hardware one (where <a title="RIM Renews Its Vow To Keep The Keyboard" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/25/rim-renews-its-vow-to-keyboards/">would RIM be</a> if Apple ever got this out the door); laser microphones that can register sound without requiring an actual opening on the device case; and  speakers that can be individually programmed to operate as tweeters, woofers and more, integrated into the screen itself.</p>
<p>As mentioned, flexible displays and the benefits they provide have been talked about for a long time. <a target="_blank" href="http://dvice.com/archives/2010/01/lg-shows-off-ne.php">LG demoed flexible digital newspapers in 2010</a>, and announced earlier this year that it would be <a target="_blank" href="http://mashable.com/2012/03/29/lg-e-paper/">deploying them soon in Europe</a> and elsewhere. Samsung is reportedly gearing up to bring them to smartphones as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ddaily.co.kr/news/news_view.php?uid=95649&amp;?ystfuv">early as next year</a>, but at this point that&#8217;s still primarily a best guess and likely to be subject to further delays.</p>
<p>All of which adds up to very little likelihood that you&#8217;ll see this kind of tech in your next iPhone or iPad. But the things flexible screens enables, specifically a reduction in the number of holes, ports and other breaks in the external casing of mobile devices, are perfectly in line with Apple&#8217;s gadget design strategy, so look for them to use this kind of thing as soon as it makes economic sense to do so.</p>
