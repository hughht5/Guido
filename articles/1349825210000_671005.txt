There&#8217;s a nice mix of developers here, too, which makes it feel much more comfortable for those of us not working for a gigantic company. Well, I suppose I work for a gigantic company, but you know what I mean.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/09/box-stats/">Box&#8217;s CEO, Aaron Levie</a>, is an interesting speaker, leader and ambassador for a new breed of enterprise entrepreneurs and enthusiasts. What he and Box stand for is something bigger than just a conference.</p>
<p>In the middle of the hustle and bustle of the closing sessions at #BoxWorks 2012, I played a bit of word association with the man who has <a target="_blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/levie">mastered the 140 character tweet</a> (TC&#8217;s words are in bold):</p>

Coming back</p>
<p><strong>Technology</strong><br />
Infinite possibilities</p>
<p><strong>Change</strong><br />
Neverending</p>
<p><strong>Oracle</strong><br />
Time running out</p>
<p><strong>Culture</strong><br />
Differentiate it</p>
<p><strong>Gangnam Style</strong><br />
Best movement ever</p>
<p><strong>Silicon Valley</strong><br />
Disneyland</p>
<p><strong>Cloud</strong><br />
Democratizes Tech</p>
<p><strong>Developers</strong><br />
We need more of them</p>
<p><strong>Box</strong><br />
Just getting started.</p>
<p>On the conference itself, here&#8217;s what Levie told me: &#8220;I think it&#8217;s going really great, this is only our second year and its been incredibly successful as far as the content and the ideas that we&#8217;ve heard from customers. It&#8217;s been a super exciting couple of days, and I really want to sleep.</p>
<p>Sleep sounds good, but we&#8217;re on to the weezer conference tonight, which completely epitomizes the movement that Levie is anchoring.</p>
