<p>Well, that wait is finally over. Motorola officially revealed the Intel-powered RAZR i at a (relatively brief) press event in London today, and as early rumors foretold it looks nearly identical to the recently-released <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/05/hands-on-with-the-droid-razr-m-the-reversal-of-big-phone-syndrome-feels-wonderful/">RAZR M</a>.</p>
<p>Seriously, not even Motorola could tell them apart &#8212; the two phones look so similar that Motorola Europe erroneously used an image of the Verizon phone in its<a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/moto-oops.png"> announcement photo</a> on Facebook. Way to go, guys.</p>
<p>That said, it should come as no surprise that both Ice Cream Sandwich-powered devices sport the same 4.3-inch Super AMOLED screen (swathed in Corning&#8217;s Gorilla Glass, naturally), 2,000mAh battery, Circle-laden UI, and the now-standard Kevlar trim around the back. The only physical difference here is the inclusion of a dedicated camera button, something that the M certainly could&#8217;ve used too.</p>
<p>Of course, the real star here can&#8217;t easily be discerned just by poking around the outside. Intel&#8217;s single-core Medfield chipset (specifically the Atom Z2480) runs the show here and its clock speed tops out at a whopping 2GHz, though what that actually means in terms of performance remains to be seen. Motorola was also quick to play up what the processor means for the device&#8217;s camera &#8212; specifically, the handset maker noted that the Camera app fire up and be ready to snap a shot in under a second.</p>
<p>Pricing has yet to be revealed (as usual), but the RAZR i is slated to touch down in the U.K., France, Germany, Argentina, Brazil and Mexico in October. Sadly, there&#8217;s no word on if/when the device will officially make its way Stateside, but if any Intel-powered smartphone to date had a shot of making it in the U.S. market, it&#8217;s this one.</p>
