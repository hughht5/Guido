It does to me. Two months before the patent was filed, I <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/24/google-plus-has-a-problem-fear-not-i-have-a-solution/">wrote here</a> &#8220;Suppose Google &#8230; let Plus users define which of their Circles see their real names, while others can only see their nicknames?&#8221;</p>
<p>I know, I know. You don&#8217;t patent ideas, you patent implementations. I was interested enough to fight my way through the legal wording and try to work out what they&#8217;re actually talking about. (Which was not easy, incidentally, even though I&#8217;m an experienced software engineer; patentese is incredibly hard to read.) There are a few nifty ideas in there: &#8220;one-time anonymous personae&#8221; and &#8220;a single persona with multiple users.&#8221; Cool. But there&#8217;s really no breathtaking insight or brilliant solution. The whole thing just seems like a very competent solution to the problem of online pseudonyms, one much like that which any other small group of good programmers would have designed.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean to come down on Google. Their patent policies are much better than those of most tech companies. But I bet most Google engineers &#8212; along with the overwhelming majority of software engineers in general &#8212; would agree with the following statement in a heartbeat: <em>most software patents are total bullshit</em>.</p>
<p>The other day I was working on a pet coding project and came up with a clever little hack that solved a nagging problem. And then I thought: <em>I wonder if that&#8217;s patentable</em>. The terrifying answer is <em>maybe.</em> If no one else had documented, or (more likely) <em>bothered</em> to document that particular solution to that particular problem, I might be able to establish a personal monopoly on its use for the next 20 years, more or less. How crazy is that? I could even come up with a fancy-sounding name: &#8220;System and method for partitioning a single index into multiple independent search spaces.&#8221; But it&#8217;s something that any other good engineer would have worked out in fairly short order.</p>
<p>Mark Burnett recently <a target="_blank" href="https://xato.net/passwords/want-to-block-common-passwords-sorry-that-is-patented/">discovered</a> that &#8220;every imaginable aspect of password selection, authentication, storage, and recovery seems to be covered by one or more patents.&#8221; Simply &#8220;checking for common or weak passwords&#8221; is covered by no less than seven different patents, almost all of which look like pure anyone-could-and-would-have-thought-of-this bullshit (though there are a couple that look more interesting &#8212; again, not <em>all</em> software patents are nonsense).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a company named PersonalWeb has filed suit against GitHub and Rackspace with yet <em>another</em> trove of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/18/patent-complaint-filed-against-rackspace-for-hosting-github/">bullshit patents</a>. Ironically, these &#8216;inventors&#8217; are so technically brilliant that they don&#8217;t seem to quite understand the complex concept of &#8220;cloud hosting,&#8221; as they&#8217;re suing Rackspace only because GitHub is hosted on their servers. You have to laugh. Because otherwise you&#8217;d weep. (Remember when RIM had to pay out <a target="_blank" href="http://money.cnn.com/2006/03/03/technology/rimm_ntp/">$600 million</a> because of five <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2012/03/04/why-patent-trolls-dont-need-valid-patents/"><em>invalid</em> patents</a>? Good times.)</p>
<p>PersonalWeb is, of course, incorporated in East Texas, because the courts there are little more than a speedy rubber stamp for even the most egregious of patent trolls. It&#8217;s both infuriating and depressing. Great swathes of the American patent system have become little more than a pathetic and tawdry playground for <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking">rent seekers</a>. And before anyone starts shouting that I want everyone to be free to steal inventions, here&#8217;s everything you need to know about today&#8217;s patent system on the back of a napkin. I give you <a target="_blank" href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/09/patent-theory-on-the-back-of-a-napkin.html">the Tabarrok curve</a>:</p>

<p>The saddest thing about all this is that (almost) everyone in the tech industry already knows it. Writing about how patents are bullshit, <em>again</em>, actually feels lazy. We&#8217;re practically overflowing with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eff.org/patent">solutions</a> to the problem. But a sizable number of enormously powerful interests are heavily incentivized to keep the system in its current spectacularly broken state. I mean, unless you count full employment for patent lawyers and patent examiners (who have become the cryptic and draconian high priests of the tech world, à la the Wizard of Oz) as the highest and most noble goal of our species. Alas, nobody has a sufficiently powerful countervailing incentive to fix it, unless you count the incentive of, you know, <em>doing the right thing</em> &#8212; but when was the last time that was a genuine factor in any decision made by Congress?</p>
<p>There are signs of light on the horizon. StackExchange&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/09/askpatents-com-a-stack-exchange-to-prevent-bad-patents/">AskPatents.com</a>. The recently launched <a target="_blank" href="http://dashes.com/anil/2012/09/tech-now-has-its-own-riaa.html">Internet Association</a>. But given the strength of the entrenched patent interests, I suspect the only way for the tech industry to change the patent system is to put together a massive campaign-contribution fund and outright buy some reform. The horrifying extent to which the American political system can be skewed by cold hard cash is hardly a smaller problem than the broken patent system, but maybe for once that sow&#8217;s ear can become a silk purse. Otherwise, I fear we&#8217;re just doomed to an endless Sisyphean treadmill of industry-wide patent wars and gridlock.</p>
<p>So I can&#8217;t blame Google. Again, they&#8217;re better than most, only engaging with the patent monster to the extent that such engagement has been forced on them. But next time, guys, just throw a cite my way, OK? I mean, what the hell &#8212; we all know it&#8217;s bullshit anyways.</p>
