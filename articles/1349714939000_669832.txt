<p>AT&amp;T and Sprint have already laid claim to LG&#8217;s flagship Optimus G handset, but what of the rest of the Big 4 national carriers? Verizon has been keeping awfully quiet on the subject &#8212; maybe because it&#8217;s still trying to push LG&#8217;s curious Intuition phablet &#8212; and for now it seems T-Mobile is making do with another, less illustrious Korean handset.</p>
<p>The carrier has just announced that it will launch the LG Optimus L9, but like nearly every other phone announcement made in the past few weeks, there&#8217;s nary a hint at pricing to be found. Even its release date is shrouded in secrecy &#8212; all T-Mobile will say is that it&#8217;s set to launch &#8220;later this fall&#8221;.</p>
<p>Even though T-Mobile and LG are clearly keeping key details hush-hush at this point, they couldn&#8217;t completely keep the news <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/253560266715983872">under wraps</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the skinny on the Ice Cream Sandwich-powered L9: it packs a 4.5-inch, Gorilla Glass 2-coated display running at 960&#215;540, and a dual-core 1GHz processor of unknown make. Meanwhile, a 5-megapixel camera can be found on the 9.1mm-thick device&#8217;s rear end, while the device&#8217;s 2,150mAh battery should keep things ticking along for quite some time. Alright, fine, it&#8217;s not the most exciting spec sheet you&#8217;re going to see over these next few months, and the L9 announcement may highlight an even bigger issue for T-Mobile &#8212; what&#8217;s going to be their big holiday seller?</p>
<p>For a while there it seemed like the natural heavy-hitter would be HTC&#8217;s One X+, which appeared on a T-Mobile document under a pseudonym. As it turns out though, the One X+ is an AT&amp;T exclusive, and the perhaps the only top-tier device that the magenta-clad carrier is expected to carry (the Galaxy Note II) is slated to launch on most other carriers as well.</p>
