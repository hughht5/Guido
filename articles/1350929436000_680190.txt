The donation, in fact, comes from money Facebook recovered from spammers around the world. The center says it will be using the grant to expand its headquarters on campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a result of numerous collaborations over the years, Facebook recognizes the center as both a partner in fighting Internet abuse, and as a critical player in developing future experts who will become dedicated cybersecurity professionals,” said Facebook Chief Security Officer and Board Member at the National Cyber Security Alliance, Joe Sullivan, in statement <a target="_blank" href="http://www.staysafeonline.org/blog/facebook-makes-grant-to-university-of-alabama-birmingham-to-fight-cybercrime/">provided</a> to StaySafeOnline.org.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar, the Center for Information Assurance and Joint Forensics Research (or, CIA|JFR) gathers resources from law enforcement, business, government agencies, and academia, as well as over 1 million spam messages per day in its UAB &#8220;Spam Data Mine.&#8221; It then uses this data to help track down, identify and stop cyber criminals and spammers. In its 35-station computer lab, students from the departments of Computer &amp; Information Sciences and Justice Sciences work with government and corporate investigators to fight against spam, phishing attacks and malware.</p>
<p>In January 2012, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-security/facebooks-continued-fight-against-koobface/10150474399670766">Facebook Security posted an announcement</a> detailing the social network&#8217;s fight against Koobface, saying that it took three years &#8220;of working closely with industry leaders, the security community, and law enforcement&#8221; in order to end its threat to Facebook users. The malware, which first surfaced in 2008, tricked users into paying for fake anti-virus software, and took control of users&#8217; computers by joining them to a botnet. Facebook said it was able to take down the botnet&#8217;s &#8220;command and control&#8221; center in March 2011, and had no new sightings of Koobface in the nine months which followed.</p>
<p>Two of the four people thanked in Facebook&#8217;s January post came from UAB: Brian Tanner, then a student and now the first UAB student to earn a master&#8217;s degree in Computer Forensics and Security Management<a target="_blank" href="https://mail.thefacebook.com/owa/redir.aspx?C=wrvQeIe8ZEqTykNdaz3BQ7M9TcDxg88I7RVGnd6hiGVnH-f2KkG8qVF77YSl6OjfvmXW73AsIVU.&amp;URL=http%3a%2f%2ftopics.sacbee.com%2fSecurity%2bManagement%2f" rel="nofollow">;</a> and Gary Warner, director of Research in Computer Forensics. The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2011/november/malware_110911/">FBI has also thanked UAB</a> in 2011 for helping it solve a cyberattack which had infected over 4 million computers across 100+ countries.</p>
<p>Richard Marchase, Ph.D., interim UAB president, had backed the creation of the CIA|JFR when he was the university&#8217;s Vice President of Research and Economic Development. &#8221;Cyberattacks are generally perpetrated by sophisticated networks, so we all realized that any successful effort to combat them would likewise require a specialized network that could compete with anything operating in the underworld,&#8221; Marchase said. &#8220;The center has already assembled an internationally respected team, and now Facebook&#8217;s generous contribution will help provide us with a state-of-the-art headquarters, positioning UAB at the vanguard of the global fight against cybercrime.&#8221;</p>
<p>The $250,000 will be used towards new CIA|JFR headquarters, located on the top of the University Boulevard Office building on campus. The HQ will include a &#8220;Facebook Suite,&#8221; scheduled to open February 12, 2013. The suite will serve at the &#8220;nerve center,&#8221; says CIA|JFR co-founder Anthony Skjellum, Ph.D., who is also chair of the UAB Department of Computer and Information Sciences. &#8220;It will be the place where cybervisionaries from around the world will gather to share ideas, discoveries and solutions,&#8221; he adds.</p>
