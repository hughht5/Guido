<p>The scene you see above is a scrum of TV journalists and their trucks getting ready to cover the even live, on location, and as it happens but we&#8217;ll do them one better: we&#8217;ll be live-blogging the event right here in a few hours.</p>
<p>Until then, sit back, relax, and wait in restless anticipation for what is usually the most interesting launch event of the year. You can check out all of our content at <a href="http://techcrunch.com/tag/apple">our Apple tag page</a> and keep your eyes here for some red hot liveblogging.</p>
