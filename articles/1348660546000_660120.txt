The survey of just under 16,000 iPhone owners in the U.S. found that compared to iOS 5, those with iOS 6 were slightly less satisfied with their devices. The drop is small, but still noteworthy because On Device says this is the first time it&#8217;s seeing a drop in satisfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have always seen an increase in device satisfaction as consumer upgrade their mobile operating system from one version to another,&#8221; On Device CEO Alistair Hill explained in an emailed statement, adding that that&#8217;s also traditionally been the case among Android OS versions. The company notes that especially compared to the jump between iOS 4 and iOS 5, which shows strong improvements, the drop from iOS 5 to iOS 6 seems especially unusual.</p>
<p>Consumers have not responded well to the replacement of Google Maps with Apple&#8217;s own mobile maps offering, which seems to be the primary source of a lot of frustration. That&#8217;s likely the problem that&#8217;s led to much of the dissatisfaction seen in the On Device survey, since aside from some issues with how the App Store now displays search results, I&#8217;ve seen few other complaints.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that despite a slight decrease in satisfaction vs. iOS 5, generally, satisfaction is still very high overall, and Apple still seems to have a significant lead on Android devices, according to a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jdpower.com/content/press-release/upO8vjP/2012-u-s-wireless-smartphone-customer-satisfaction-study-and-2012-u-s-wireless-traditional-mobile-phone-satisfaction-study.htm">recent study by J.D. Power</a>. In other words, while iOS 6 may have some disappointing features, judging by these results it looks unlikely to have a material effect on iOS device sales going forward.</p>
