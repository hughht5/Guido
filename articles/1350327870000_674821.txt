<p>The company offers mobile publishers a platform for adding game mechanics to their apps, including a rewards system called mPoints. The goal is to increase user engagement and retention. And apparently, these efforts are actually paying off, with developers seeing a 35 percent increase in retention rate and a 25 percent lower bounce rate after integrating SessionM.</p>
<p>By looking at publisher data and performing its own A/B testing, the company also compared activity between SessionM users and non-users. It said that SessionM led to a 250 percent lift in in-app activities per visit, and the SessionM users were 40 times more likely to perform in-app social activities, like sharing content and checking-in.</p>
<p>I did wonder whether the difference can be solely attributed to SessionM — it may also be that people who use SessionM are just more likely to engage in these types of activities. When I brought this up while writing the post, a spokesperson responded:</p>
<blockquote><p>So, SessionM thinks this is a fair question but we actually have seen an increase in key in-app activities among SessionM users. Moreover, SessionM metrics including the overall increase in retention and decrease in bounce rate across all app users point to a direct correlation between engagement lift and SessionM. So yes, we can confidently say we&#8217;ve driven engagement.</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition to helping publishers with engagement, SessionM also provides an opt-in platform for advertisers. CEO Lars Albright (who previously co-founded and led mobile ad network Quattro, which was acquired by Apple) said he was particularly pleased that users seem to receptive to the company&#8217;s ad efforts. &#8220;Many&#8221; developers are actually seeing users opt-in to the ad platform at rates above 70 percent, according to SessionM.</p>
<p>Lastly, Albright claimed that the company is seeing impressive numbers across all of its publisher categories.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not just going after a gaming audience that&#8217;s young and male,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re going after the whole mobile audience.&#8221;</p>
