The <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/19/marc-benioff-highlights-man-machines-and-social-networks-in-dreamforce-keynote/">Salesforce/Dreamforce keynote</a> was interrupted during its Ustream streaming due to copyright protection.</p>

<p>Oopsy. But maybe not? Apparently, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/03/ustream-apologizes-for-shutting-down-the-hugo-awards-livestream-says-it-will-recalibrate/">this has happened before</a>.</p>
<p>For you enterprise junkies, I&#8217;m sure that it&#8217;ll be fixed immediately, otherwise Benioff will go off on someone.</p>

<blockquote><p>I want to let you know in regards to the Salesforce Keynote Ustream broadcast that this time period to be hidden off of their Ustream channel was pre-planned, approved and instructed by Salesforce. </p></blockquote>
<p>I have no idea why Salesforce would do this, but Ustream clearly needs to fix their error messages. At least Ustream gave me a tour and some candy.</p>
