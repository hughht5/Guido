Today, the program is holding its first demo day in San Francisco. What&#8217;s especially interesting about Start-Up Chile is that the program, which started in 2010 and has already graduated four classes, isn&#8217;t just trying to attract Chilean entrepreneurs. Instead, the Chilean government is making a concerted effort to attract companies from around the world. Many of the 19 startups that are presenting in San Francisco today (and many of which also attended TechCrunch Disrupt this week) hail from countries like Singapore, New Zealand, India and Canada.</p>
<p>As Start-Up Chile&#8217;s executive director Horacio Melo told me earlier this week, the program has become so popular that it has now moved from just trying hard to attract people to getting over 1,000 applications for every one of its 100-company classes. These companies get $40,000 to move to Chile for <a target="_blank" href="http://startupchile.org/about/faqs/">at least six months</a>. Our own Alex Williams wrote a good summary of how the program works <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/13/how-start-up-chile-is-attracting-startups-from-singapore-london-and-san-francisco/">earlier this week</a>.</p>
