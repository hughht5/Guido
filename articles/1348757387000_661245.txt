<p>The Birthday Doodle is a rather simplistic affair, compared to some Doodles past (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/doodles/30th-anniversary-of-pac-man">playable Pacman</a> was a particular highlight) &#8212; showing a layer cake that breaks down to spell out the Google logo, while the cake&#8217;s candles rearrange to chalk up the 14 years since Larry and Sergey set up their startup in a Menlo Park garage.</p>
<p>Google was incorporated in California in September 1998, and hired its first employee, Craig Silverstein, shortly after. The company now employees close to 55,000 staff globally &#8212; following its <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/15/breaking-google-buys-motorola-for-12-5-billion/">acquisition of Motorola Mobility</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the headcount breakdown from <a target="_blank" href="http://investor.google.com/earnings/2012/Q2_google_earnings.html">Google&#8217;s Q2 2012 financial report</a></p>
<blockquote><p>On a worldwide basis, we employed 54,604 full-time employees (34,311 in our Google business and 20,293 in our Motorola business) as of June 30, 2012, compared to 33,077 full-time employees as of March 31, 2012.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the dark days before Google&#8217;s maths nerds arrived to tackle the problem of speedily locating relevant data online, web users had to made do with search engines such as Yahoo! and &#8212; shudder to recall it &#8212; AltaVista.</p>
<p>As well as having a stated mission to organize the world&#8217;s information (and an implicit one to make pots of money from advertising), an epic quest that has seen Google spread its obsessive-compulsive tentacles from the web as viewed on desktop PCs to the mobile internet via apps and its own OS <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/07/google-cars-300000-miles-without-accident/">and beyond</a>, it has also, from time to time, expressed its business philosophy via the phrase &#8216;don&#8217;t be evil&#8217; &#8212; <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2008/04/15/googles-dont-be-evil-not-ordained-motto-says-marissa-mayer/">an informal slogan</a> that has <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/23/facebook-and-twitter-engineers-fight-google-search-plus-your-world-with-dont-be-evil/">inevitably been used against it</a>.</p>
<p>Being insanely successful and not being perceived as monstrously evil is a problem all the PhDs in Mountain View appear unable to solve.</p>
<p>Over the years Google has launched scores of products, from Gmail email to Google maps to the Chrome browser and the Android mobile OS, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/04/wave-goodbye-to-google-wave/">shuttered</a> plenty of others, and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Google">acquired an epic list of companies</a>. Biggies include YouTube, DoubleClick and, most recently, Motorola.</p>
<p>It has also got into a fair few fights &#8212; both <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/02/01/bing-google-fight/">directly</a> and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/27/googles-eric-schmidt-talks-apple-partnership-samsung-and-patent-problems/">indirectly</a> &#8211; while Mountain View&#8217;s relationship with governments around the world can best be described as <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/18/google-transparency-report-u-s-content-removal-requests-increased-103/">love/hate</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s to the next decade+ of Google&#8217;s growth. And rest assured, we&#8217;ll be seeing plenty more Google-induced teenage tantrums in those coming years.</p>
