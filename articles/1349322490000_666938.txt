I proceeded to visit my fiancee&#8217;s wall and pick something out that she might like. There were a ton of options, including flowers and a bonsai tree. I opted for the bonsai tree.</p>
<p>Well, the package came today and we were extremely excited to open it up and start growing our new tree. As the package was opened, she looked at me and said &#8220;Could they fit more branding on this if they tried?&#8221;</p>
<p>She was right. What the hell is this?</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/03/hey-facebook-could-you-fit-any-more-fucking-branding-on-your-gifts/photo-18-3/" rel="attachment wp-att-666952"></a></p>
<p>Really Facebook? There&#8217;s a sticker on the outside package, and the gift itself is in a Facebook-branded bag. There’s also a card in a &#8212; wait for it &#8212; Facebook-branded envelope. Ok, we get it. The gift came via fucking Facebook. Yes, I know that this is your monetization strategy. Yes I know that investors are excited and giddy, but come on&#8230;</p>
<p>At one point I half-expected Zuck to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/26/facebook-poke-war/">hop out and Poke me</a>.</p>
<p>After unwrapping this branded mess for 10 minutes, we found the gift. I wonder if brands will have a problem with their goodies being so hidden. Branding. Ugh.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Apparently, this abomination started with Karma, which Facebook acquired:</p>

<p>Double ugh.</p>
