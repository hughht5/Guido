Big Blue&#8217;s GAAP earnings came in at $3.8 billion, up 3% from the last quarter. Non-GAAP earnings were $4.2 billion. Overall, the company reported revenue of $24.7 billion, down from $25.8 billion in Q2.</p>
<p>Ahead of the earnings release, most analyst expected that Big Blue would report robust earnings. The <a target="_blank" href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ae?s=IBM+Analyst+Estimates">consensus</a> was that earnings per share would increase to around $3.62 (up from last quarter&#8217;s $3.51 non-GAAP EPS), but that overall revenue would decline to about $25.4 billion from $25.8 billion last quarter. With $24.7 billion, the company clearly missed the analyst&#8217;s expectations.</p>

<p>IBM&#8217;s last quarterly earnings were mixed. While revenue was down 3 percent compared to the previous quarter, IBM noted that, after adjusting for currency, it was actually up 1 percent. This time around, the company argued that, after adjusting for currency, its revenue would still have been down 2 percent. Currency fluctuations impacted revenue growth by nearly $1 billion.</p>
<p>IBM&#8217;s non-GAAP gross profit margin for Q2 2012 was 47.6 percent. For Q3, the company reported an improved non-GAAP profit margin of 48.1 percent.</p>
<p>The company did not provide any guidance for Q3 in its last earnings release, but it did raise its full-year EPS expectations to at least $15.10 in its last quarterly release.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In the third quarter, we continued to drive margin, profit and earnings growth through our focus on higher-value businesses, strategic growth initiatives and productivity,&#8221; said Ginni Rometty, IBM chairman, president and chief executive officer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looking ahead, we see good opportunity with a strong product lineup heading into this quarter and annuity businesses that provide a solid base of revenue, profit and cash. We are reiterating our full-year 2012 operating earnings per share expectation of at least $15.10.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
