First, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.macrumors.com/2012/10/05/apple-preparing-to-begin-shipping-fifth-generation-ipod-touch-to-customers/">MacRumors</a> reports that pre-order customers are seeing their order status turn to &#8220;Preparing for Shipment,&#8221; and separately, Japanese Apple-watching site <a target="_blank" href="http://www.macotakara.jp/blog/ipod/entry-17930.html">Macotakara</a> reports that Apple will begin selling both the new touch and the new iPod nano starting October 9 in Japan.</p>
<p>One customer is also reporting that his credit card has been charged, according to MacRumors, which generally means that the shipping process is underway. yesterday, estimates in Australia changed from October to an estimated wait time of &#8220;3 weeks,&#8221; and some new customers just pre-ordering now were seeing specific scheduled delivery dates of later in October and the beginning of November.</p>
<p>Apple had said that the iPod touch and nano would ship sometime in October, but gave no definite timeframe. Here&#8217;s hoping users will be able to get our hands on some of the new hardware soon. If you&#8217;ve pre-ordered, and are seeing your status changed or your card charged, let us know in the comments.</p>
