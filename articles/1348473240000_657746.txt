With that requirement dumped, the stage is set for its next move: a full blown assault on the European market following its <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/20/fab-buys-casacanda-for-11m-to-fight-the-samwers-in-europe/">acquisition</a> this year of Germany player Casacanda and most recently <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/19/ten-week-old-llustre-is-acquired-by-fab-com-after-a-blistering-european-roll-up/">Llustre in the UK</a>. The new <a target="_blank" href="http://eu.fab.com">&#8216;Fab Europe&#8217;</a> site opens today.</p>
<p>Thus, through acquisition and slicing off existing members in the region, Fab now claims it has 2 million members in Europe, who will now be able to browse a fully-targeted European site. The Europe team is also now on pace, says the company, to represent about 30% or $150m of Fab’s 2012 sales and boasts almost 200 staff.</p>
<p>Perhaps most interestingly, Fab has moved its entire European operations to Berlin, including its former London staff.</p>
<p>CEO and cofounder Jason Goldberg told us that overall the site now boats 7.5m members worldwide and has grown 50% since Jan 1st.</p>
<p>With its Casacanda acquisition, Fab Europe started in February in German-language only, and only serving the German and Austrian markets. However, that was operating on the platform of its acquired entities. The new European site is fully on Fab&#8217;s Social Commerce Platform which is built around social sharing, targeting 26 countries in North America and the EU. Fab Europe will be brought onto Fab’s mobile apps in the next 2 weeks.</p>
<p>The company earlier this summer raised <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/18/fab-seals-the-deal-on-105-million-in-new-funding/">$105 million</a> in funding at a reported $700 million valuation, bringing the total raised to $156 million. </p>
