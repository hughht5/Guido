<p>And the launches just keep coming. Last week, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/brit">San Francisco-based startup</a> made its first move into the e-commerce space <a target="_blank" href="http://www.brit.co/britkits/">Brit Kits</a>, monthly deliveries of boxes full of materials for making the most popular DIY crafts and projects featured on Brit + Co.&#8217;s &#8220;creative living&#8221; editorial <a target="_blank" href="http://www.brit.co/">site</a>.</p>
<p>In the same vein as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/birchbox">Birchbox</a> and the like, Brit Kits will be offered as a monthly subscription service that costs $19.99/month. The contents will vary pretty widely, as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.brit.co/introducing-brit-kits-our-most-popular-diy-projects-delivered-monthly/">Morin says</a> there will be kits &#8220;related to everything from home decor to food to fashion.&#8221; To get people fully prepped for the wide world of DIY, Brit + Co. is also selling a &#8220;starter kit&#8221; for $29.99, which contains basic crafting items such as an Xacto knife, a glue gun, and a hole punch.</p>
<p>Brit + Co. has pulled in revenue from day one through brand partnerships and sponsorships from companies <a target="_blank" href="http://sfluxe.com/2012/08/30/brit-morin-stars-in-new-uniqlo-campaign">such as Uniqlo</a>. But opening up the e-commerce angle represents its first foray into making really scalable direct-to-consumer revenue. From the outset, I think it fills a nice niche in the very hot online subscription commerce sector, as it&#8217;s something that could appeal to teenaged girls and middle-aged women alike. It&#8217;ll be interesting to see how it grows going forward.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Morin tells me that there is much &#8220;more to come&#8221; when it comes to commerce &#8212; and Brit + Co.&#8217;s expansion in general. Given what she&#8217;s built and shipped since launching the company <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/16/brit-morin-launches-lifestyle-brand-brit-wants-to-be-silicon-valleys-martha-stewart/">just ten months ago</a>, I&#8217;d wager that there&#8217;s reason to believe her.</p>
<p>Last month TechCrunch TV sat down with Morin at Brit + Co.&#8217;s San Francisco headquarters, to talk about the company&#8217;s recent growth and check out its newest native iPhone app. You can watch that interview in the video embedded below:<br />
