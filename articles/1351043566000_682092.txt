<a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> made some <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/23/our-coverage-of-the-apple-event-ipad-mini-4th-generation-ipad-new-imac-mac-mini-13-retina-macbook-pro/">pretty big announcements</a> at an event held in Silicon Valley this morning: The debut of the long-rumored <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/23/ipad-mini/">iPad Mini</a>, a brand <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/23/apple-unveils-totally-redesigned-27-and-21-5-imac-thinner-ssdhd-fusion-drive/">new iMac</a>, more relatively affordable <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/23/apple-adds-a-retina-screen-to-the-13-inch-macbook-pro/">Retina-enabled MacBooks</a>, and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/23/our-coverage-of-the-apple-event-ipad-mini-4th-generation-ipad-new-imac-mac-mini-13-retina-macbook-pro">much more</a>. </p>
<p>While TechCrunch has had great coverage of all this, it&#8217;s been such a big day for tech industry news &#8212; Facebook posted <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/23/facebook-q3-2012-financials/">impressive earnings</a>, Zynga made <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/23/zynga-ceo-mark-pincus-confirms-layoffs-5-of-workforce-potential-closures-for-u-k-japan-offices/">painful layoffs</a>, Netflix disappointed Wall Street with news that its <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/23/netflix-subscriber-additions-disappoint-reports-q3-revenue-of-905m-and-earnings-of-0-13/">subscription growth nosedived</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/michael-arrington">Michael Arrington</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/mg-siegler">MG Siegler</a> were both <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/23/getting-the-band-back-together/">gloriously re-Crunched</a> &#8212; that you may not have had the chance to fully take in all the news out of Apple. And we can&#8217;t have that, can we? Of course not!</p>
<p>So I pulled aside my colleague <a href="http://techcrunch.com/author/darrell-etherington/">Darrell Etherington</a> here in the TechCrunch TV studio today to get his first-hand insights on this morning&#8217;s Apple event. He was there covering the event in person, and since he&#8217;s pretty much an Apple expert (and had the chance to have a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/23/hands-on-with-apples-new-ipad-mini-good-things-do-come-in-small-packages/">good amount</a> of hands-on time with <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/23/the-ipad-mini-and-the-new-13-retina-macbook-pro-strut-their-stuff-in-our-hands-on-video/">the iPad Mini and the new iMac</a>) it was fun to hear him talk about his overall impression of the event and all the new releases. </p>
<p>Watch the video embedded above to hear why buying an iPad Mini might mean your old iPad starts to gather dust, how the fact that the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/23/confirmed-apple-will-live-stream-todays-ipad-mini-event-on-web-site-apple-tv/">event was live streamed</a> impacted the blog world&#8217;s coverage (and the vibe in the room), how the audience reacted to Tim Cook and Phil Schiller, what Apple&#8217;s next big launch might be, and more.</p>
