<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/image001.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="image001" title="image001" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.minted.com">Minted</a>, the marketplace for prints designed by independent graphic artists probably still best known for its flagship <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2008/07/21/minted-launches-competitive-stationary-store/">stationery business</a>, is spreading its wings. First came the debut of its <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/10/minted-art-prints/">wall art vertical</a> this past summer. And today, the company is getting into another space: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.minted.com/party">Party decor</a>.</p>
<p>Piñatas and tacky noisemakers this is not. In keeping with Minted&#8217;s higher-end focus and design aesthetic, these party goods are going more for &#8220;chic&#8221; than &#8220;cheap.&#8221; Minted&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.minted.com/party">party decorations</a> will be sold in coordinated &#8220;suites&#8221; that start at $65 and contain things like personalized printed banners, table centerpieces, cupcake toppers, and confetti, which can be bought along with matched invitations and thank you cards.</p>
<p>Now, the news itself is reasonably interesting &#8212; printing and shipping confetti is a bit different from printing stationery, and the whole thing fits very well into the trend of people ogling well-designed parties <a target="_blank" href="http://pinterest.com/search/?q=party+decorations">on Pinterest</a>. But the larger theme here is how Minted, which was founded in 2008 and has taken on <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/15/benchmark-marissa-mayer-put-5-5m-in-stationery-design-and-retail-site-minted/">$8 million in venture capital funding</a>, is now positioning itself as more than just a printing startup, but as a big idea lifestyle company.</p>
<p>&#8220;Minted has evolved into a multi-category design and lifestyle brand for the mass affluent woman,&#8221; founder and CEO Mariam Naficy told me in an email this week. &#8220;By crowd-sourcing design from our immensely talented community of designers, Minted can rapidly launch new categories with superior design and selection.&#8221;</p>
<p>That certainly sounds to me like more vertical launches are on the way going forward, all aimed at the relatively niche but very valuable demographic of affluent, web- and design-savvy women which is also being targeted well by the aforementioned <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pinterest.com">Pinterest</a> and a number of other newer startups such as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.brit.co">Brit &amp; Co</a>.</p>
<p>It all jibes with what Naficy told me earlier this summer at the launch of wall art, its first big step outside of stationery. She said then that Minted&#8217;s expansion has been really driven by the group of designers and artists who submit their work to the site and receive a commission on items ultimately printed and sold with their designs &#8212; a tight-knit online community that has dubbed itself &#8216;Minties.&#8217; She said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As we saw all of this beautiful art streaming in, we realized we weren&#8217;t really a stationery retailer, we were a design community. The range and the strength of our designers was so strong that it can be used in different ways as artwork in people’s homes&#8230; The designers don’t define themselves in terms of product categories.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
