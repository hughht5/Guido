In the future, cleaning with Exec should be a higher quality, faster experience, and it will come with a higher price tag to match.</p>
<p>Until now, everything in Exec came at a standard price of $25 per hour. For the new cleaning service, the per-hour rate has more than doubled to $65. That doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;ll actually pay twice as much â€” Exec is now sending two people to do the job, so it should take less time.</p>
<p>Co-founder Justin Kan (formerly the Justin of Justin.tv) tells me this is very much an experiment. Cleaning is one of Exec&#8217;s most popular services, and he says the company noticed that it was doing a lot of work behind-the-scenes to improve the experience. So the team decided to go all out, asking itself, &#8220;If we could make this the best possible experience, what would we do?&#8221; The answer involves Exec-trained cleaners, eco-friendly cleaning supplies from the company, key pick-up and drop-off, and laundry service.</p>
<p>Exec is currently <a target="_blank" href="https://iamexec.com/cleaning">beta testing the system here</a>. It plans to phase out the old cleaning system, and during the transition period, it&#8217;s only charging $50 per hour.</p>
<p>If Exec is willing to break away from the $25 per hour model for cleaning, can we expect it to do the same in other areas? Kan says that for the &#8220;near future&#8221;, he only plans to apply this model to cleaning: &#8220;I like to take things one step at a time.&#8221; But eventually, he says it&#8217;s possible that Exec might start offering improved or &#8220;streamlined&#8221; experiences, and charging more for them.</p>
