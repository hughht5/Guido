Each month, couples receive a DateBook with beautifully presented, one-of-a-kind dates specifically curated for its users. Couples just have to select their romantic local experiences and the service will take care of everything. On top of that, the newly launched service offers a more traditional dating site to find someone special to go on those dates. The date remains the common thread between the two core products.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most important thing couples can do to continuously enrich their relationships is to have wonderful experiences together,&#8221; said Brian Schechter, co-founder of HowAboutWe. &#8220;We decided that, by focusing on experiences for two, we could make the HowAboutWe concept work both for people in relationships and for people looking for relationships,&#8221; he continued.</p>
<p>For the month of October, the company provides ten different dates to enjoy, from a nice hike in Harriman State Park with pickup in New York to a private 3-course brunch at Kin Shop with Top Chef Harold Dieterle. After having subscribed for $80 a month, couples can enjoy free dates, such as a Korean food cooking class, or spend a little more money if they want to try something special.</p>
<p>The subscription was needed to differentiate the site from deals services, such as Groupon. Members-only experiences tend to be more attractive to business owners compared to one-off buying models. So far, 24,000 users have already taken part in the private alpha testing with an impressive retention rate of 80 percent month over month.</p>
<p>Finding new deals every month will be hard for the team. DateBooks come with a few words from Michelle Dozois, HowAboutWe&#8217;s editor, because the company considers its dates as content just like any other content website would. &#8220;To get these incredible experiences that you can&#8217;t get anywhere else, we work closely with New York&#8217;s smartest life-style curators and with top-tier vendors to craft the dates,&#8221; Schechter said.</p>
<p>Yet, associating a dating site with a truly innovative date experiences service seems odd. According to Schechter, finding your soulmate on the service is just one way to start signing up for dates â€” &#8220;we wanted to overcome the core paradox of traditional online dating businesses: when you succeed, your customer no longer needs you. Our couples product is partly a solution to churn.&#8221;</p>
<p>HowAboutWe has raised $18.5 million so far. RRE led the $3.2 million Series A round, Khosla Ventures led the $15 million Series B round. Other investors include Josh Kushner at Thrive, Founder Collective, LaunchTime, FF Venture Capital, High Line, NYC Seed and MHS Capital.</p>
<p>The service is currently available in New York City, with plans to expand in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, Chicago, Washington DC and more in 2013. It has just launched its public version and TechCrunch readers can <a target="_blank" href="https://couples.howaboutwe.com/get-started">sign up</a> and skip the waiting list.</p>
