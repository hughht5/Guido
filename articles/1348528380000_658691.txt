As TechCrunch <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/23/3taps-is-planning-to-file-a-countersuit-against-craigslist-tomorrow-citing-antitrust-laws-and-uncompetitive-behavior/">reported it would yesterday</a>, 3Taps has today filed a countersuit against Craigslist in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, responding point by point to Craigslist&#8217;s allegations of copyright infringement and further levelling counter-accusations at Craigslist of uncompetitive and antitrust behavior. We&#8217;ve embedded the full suit below.</p>
<p>Craigslist has been suing 3Taps and another company, PadMapper, over the use of Craiglist&#8217;s listings data in 3Taps&#8217; API, with PadMapper named in the suit for being a user of that API.</p>
<p>So far, it&#8217;s only 3Taps named in the counterclaim, but TechCrunch understands that this could potentially change, as there are a number of companies that have been issued with cease &amp; desist letters by Craigslist. One that has talked to TechCrunch noted that if it gets named in Craigslist&#8217;s suit, it will consider joining the counterclaim.</p>
<p>This story began life as a few startups taking advantage of the fact that Craigslist data is freely searchable on Google but is notoriously difficult to navigate; then took a proprietary turn when Craigslist started to crack down on them using its data. Now it has reached a legal juncture.</p>
<p>While several of the smaller companies that were issued with C&amp;Ds by Craigslist simply shut down operations, 3Taps has taken a different route. Represented by the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom, 3Taps and its founder/CEO Greg Kidd feel that this is more than just a fight about getting to use Craiglist data, but also about how data in the public domain should be treated legally, what rights third parties should have to this data, and what the separation should be between technological innovation and information.</p>
<p>A comment from Sherwin Siy, VP of legal affairs at data advocacy group <a target="_blank" href="http://www.publicknowledge.org">Public Knowledge</a>, believes that Craigslist may have some difficulty proving their position on copyright:</p>
<blockquote><p>The vast majority of postings on Craigslist aren&#8217;t going to be covered by copyright anyway. For something to be copyrighted, it has to have at least a &#8220;modicum of creativity.&#8221; My Craigslist posting about how I have a chair for sale for $25 (OBO) is not at all creative. And even if there&#8217;s a minority of posts that are creative, the copyright in those posts belongs to the people who wrote them, not Craigslist.</p>
<p>Craigslist might be trying to claim that their terms of service require posters to sign their rights over to Craigslist, but that&#8217;s highly unlikely to be held a valid transfer of rights by a court.</p>
<p>Basically, there&#8217;s not much of a copyright case there for Craigslist.</p></blockquote>
<p>More to come.</p>
