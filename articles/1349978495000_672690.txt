The <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/30/paperwhite-kindle-review/">Kindle Paperwhite</a> is now available to pre-order in the U.K., Germany, France, Italy and Spain. Canada won&#8217;t get it for now.</p>
<p>Both the 3G and Wi-Fi only models are available in those countries. The Wi-Fi variant costs €129 or £109 (around $170, sales tax included) while the 3G version costs €189 or £169 (respectively $244 and $271). As special offers are not available in Europe, the Kindle Paperwhite will come without ads.</p>
<p>British customers should expect their device sooner than other Europeans as shipments will begin on October 25 in the U.K. and on November 22 elsewhere.</p>
<p>Right after the official release of the Kindle Paperwhite in the U.S., Amazon had to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/03/amazon-sells-out-of-new-kindle-paperwhite-shipping-slips-to-4-6-weeks/">delay</a> shipments. Amazon.com still displays the same 4 to 6 weeks delay notice. The company may have chosen to set aside devices for the European launch.</p>
<p>Paperwhite&#8217;s success is no surprise. In our review, John Biggs qualified it as <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/30/paperwhite-kindle-review/">a reader&#8217;s dream</a>. The new lightning system, the improved screen and the updated touch interface are the key points of the update.</p>
<p>Now that Amazon is refining its e-reader every year, the company must proceed quickly for international availability if it doesn&#8217;t want to release an obsolete device just before the end of a release cycle.</p>
