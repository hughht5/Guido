Chartboost is also seeing 15% uptake on its network, with users coming on board at an average rate of about 1 percent every two hours or so, with spikes around quitting time on Tuesday and picking steam again early Thursday morning.</p>
<p>Chartboost has also broken down the data by device, revealing that iPhone owners were fastest to adopt, with iPhone owners most eager to adopt at 17% after 24 hours, the iPad coming in second with 13% upgraded after Day One, and the iPod touch bringing up the rear with 9 percent uptake. That&#8217;s actually pretty much in line with what you might expect after seeing our <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/19/ios-6-is-now-available-heres-what-features-your-idevice-gets/">chart yesterday detailing new iOS 6 features</a>; the iPhone 4S gets the most out of iOS 6 by far (besides the as-yet unreleased iPhone 5), the new iPad also gaining quite a bit but not everything, and the 4th gen iPod touch (the only one currently available on the chart) bringing up the rear.</p>

<p>Now that both Chitika and Chartboost have tracked the same growth curve acting independently, it&#8217;s pretty clear that iOS 6 is the fastest-adopted mobile OS out of Cupertino yet. Let&#8217;s see if it can keep up that pace over the longer term.</p>
