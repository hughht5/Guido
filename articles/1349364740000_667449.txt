<p>The news comes as HP continues its effort to make WebOS a secure, open platform.</p>
<p>First spotted by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thepowerbase.com/2012/10/hp-hiring-50-engineers-to-work-directly-on-webos/">The Powerbase</a>, the job openings are in Shanghai and Sunnyvale. All are high-paying engineering positions.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a sample of the job openings:</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a good sign that HP is committing to make WebOS secure and open-source. It shows the company sees something that can come of an effort that has had its fair share of failures and lost opportunities.</p>
<p>But what will HP do with it in the end? As The Powerbase points out, let&#8217;s just hope that HP is not foolish enough to put WebOS back into the consumer market.</p>
<p>The future of WebOS is in the enterprise. The market is not sewn up. Apple has taken a good lead but the company is not committed to making an enterprise play. The Android platform is fractured, RIM is all but dead and Android is too fractured.</p>
<p>HP is committing to WebOS. We&#8217;ll just have to wait to see what that commitment means.</p>
