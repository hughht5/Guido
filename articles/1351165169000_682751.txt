For the period ending September 30, the company reported negative EPS of $.26 on revenues of $7.3 billion, an increase of nearly 6 percent year-over-year.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s down from revenues of $8.8 billion in <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/26/sprint-q2-2012-earnings-net-loss-widens-to-1-4b-1-5m-iphones-sold/">Q2 2012</a>. The company also reported an operating loss of $231 million.</p>
<p>Sprint missed Wall Street expectations, as analysts estimated that Sprint would lose $.44 per share with revenues of $8.8 billion.</p>
<p>As always the iPhone plays a central role in Sprint&#8217;s story, and this quarter the company says it&#8217;s activated 1.5 million iPhones. That&#8217;s flat from <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/26/sprint-q2-2012-earnings-net-loss-widens-to-1-4b-1-5m-iphones-sold/">1.5 million last quarter</a>, and 40 percent of that represents new customers. Post-paid subscriber base grew with net additions of 410,000.</p>
<p>Verizon and AT&amp;T both just reported their third quarter numbers, with both selling a whopping <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/18/verizon-activated-3-1-million-iphones-in-q3-2012-615k-were-iphone-5s/">3.1 million</a> and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/24/att-q3-2012/">4.7 million respectively</a>. Obviously, Sprint can&#8217;t quite match these numbers just yet but the increase in post-paid subscribers compared to the same quarter last year is true evidence that the plan is working.</p>
<p>An infusion from <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/11/sprint-confirms-talks-with-japanese-wireless-carrier-softbank-corp/">Japanese SoftBank</a> would go a long ways, considering both companies have so much in common (the iPhone, LTE frequencies, a bronze medal or two).</p>
<p>Sprint Nextel Corp. (NYSE: S) today reported wireless service revenues of nearly $7.3 billion during the quarter, an increase of nearly 6 percent year-over-year. Wireless service revenues for the Sprint platform grew 14 percent year-over-year driven by postpaid ARPU growth of $3.01 and continued subscriber growth.</p>
<p>The company reported a net loss of $767 million and a diluted net loss of $.26 per share for the third quarter of 2012 as compared to a net loss of $301 million and a diluted net loss of $.10 per share in the third quarter of 2011. Sprint’s third quarter 2012 results include accelerated depreciation of $397 million, or negative $.13 per share (pre-tax), primarily related to Network Vision, including the expected shutdown of the Nextel platform.</p>
<p>The Sprint platform postpaid subscriber base grew for the tenth consecutive quarter, with net additions of 410,000 driven by a postpaid Nextel recapture rate of 59 percent and best ever third quarter churn. Sprint recorded approximately 1.5 million iPhone® sales in the third quarter with 40 percent representing new customers. The company also surpassed 1 million LTE smartphones sold prior to the launch of iPhone 5.</p>
<p>“The Sprint platform performed well, with strong net subscriber additions, record third quarter postpaid and prepaid churn and robust revenue growth, contributing to Adjusted OIBDA* of $1.28 billion even as we continue to invest in Network Vision and position the company for future growth,” said Dan Hesse, Sprint CEO. “As a result, we believe we will slightly exceed the top of the range of our recently increased Adjusted OIBDA forecast.”</p>
