It allows retailers to add &#8220;Want&#8221; or &#8220;Collect&#8221; buttons to news feed post about products. These save and share products to a &#8220;Wishlist&#8221; on user profiles and can be clicked through to make purchases.</p>
<p>Seven retail partners including Pottery Barn and Fab can now share Collections posts to their fans.</p>
<p>Collections could help retailers score viral click throughs to their product pages by making things their fans are interested in more discoverable to friends. Facebook isn&#8217;t making affiliate fees on Collections click throughs, but it could get brands to buy ads to get more fans.</p>
