Not surprisingly, both defended the pricing decision and talked quality.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we set out to build the iPad mini, we didn&#8217;t set out to build a small, cheap tablet,&#8221; Oppenheimer said. Instead, he argued that Apple&#8217;s goal was to replicate the high-quality experience of the standard iPad.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple will not make a product that someone may feel good about the moment they&#8217;re paying for it, but then when they get home they rarely use it again,&#8221; Cook said. &#8220;I would encourage you to use an iPad mini and I don&#8217;t think that you&#8217;ll be using anything other than another iPad after that.&#8221;</p>
