Not surprisingly, both defended the pricing decision and talked quality.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we set out to build the iPad mini, we didn&#8217;t set out to build a small, cheap tablet,&#8221; Oppenheimer said. Instead, he argued that Apple&#8217;s goal was to replicate the high-quality experience of the standard iPad.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple will not make a product that someone may feel good about the moment they&#8217;re paying for it, but then when they get home they rarely use it again,&#8221; Cook said. &#8220;I would encourage you to use an iPad mini and I don&#8217;t think that you&#8217;ll be using anything other than another iPad after that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cook&#8217;s statements were based on the fact that the existing iPad continues to own an outsized portion of<a target="_blank" href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/12/09/27/apple-ipad-dominates-tablet-based-web-browsing-with-98-share-report-says"> tablet browsing usage</a> and other engagement stats. He&#8217;s arguing that the iPad mini will likewise be an experience that provides value over a longer term than cheaper Android tablets, suggesting a lot of those make it home but then don&#8217;t become a daily use device.</p>
<p>&#8220;Customers are very smart, have high expectations and they want a device that can do more,&#8221; Cook said. He also addressed the rest of the competition in response to a later question, adding, that &#8221;[The iPad mini] is not a compromised product, like the 7-inch tablets. It&#8217;s in a whole different league.&#8221;</p>
