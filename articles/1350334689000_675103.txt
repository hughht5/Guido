The terms of the agreement were not disclosed.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/15/esri-acquires-location-platform-geoloqi-plans-to-launch-alternative-ios-mapping-library-soon/esri-10globelogo_srgbflat/" rel="attachment wp-att-675137"></a>Geoloqi was founded in 2010 and raised about $350,000 in a seed round in 2011. Most recently, the company announced a number of partnerships with companies like Appcelerator, Factual and Locaid that, the company <a target="_blank" href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/03/11/geoloqi-partnerships/">said at the time</a>, would give it the potential to reach 1.6 million developers. In today&#8217;s announcement, Geoloqi also noted that it currently serves about 1,000 developers and customers. These users will continue to be able to use the company&#8217;s current products and service will not be interrupted.</p>
<p>Esri, which was founded in 1969, currently provides its GIS technology to about 300,000 organizations worldwide, and its clients include a number of national governments, large cities, Fortune 500 companies and over 7,000 colleges and universities.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to have the team at Geoloqi and its technology become part of the Esri family,&#8221; said Jack Dangermond, Esri&#8217;s president in a canned statement today. &#8220;Geoloqi&#8217;s capabilities and relationships with the developer community will build on Esri&#8217;s already impressive suite of ArcGIS products to create more dynamic mobile and web applications.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Geoloqi co-founder and CEO Amber Case, the two companies&#8217; tools and platforms &#8220;are very complementary.&#8221; Geoloqi will now become Esri&#8217;s R&amp;D Center in Portland. The R&amp;D Center, the companies&#8217; noted in today&#8217;s announcement, will be focused on developing new tools and features to &#8220;create improved, integrated products that accentuate the strength of a combined platform.&#8221;</p>
<h2>New Products Coming Soon</h2>
<p>The two companies are already working to bring a number of new features to their users, including extended geocoding features using Esri&#8217;s ArcGIS Reverse Geocoding service, for example. In addition, the two companies will soon launch a new alternative mapping library for iOS. The ArcGIS iOS SDK, says Esri, will provide developers &#8220;with an alternative to MapKit, the default mapping library on iOS. The ArcGIS SDK provides access to high quality map tiles in a programming interface similar to MapKit.&#8221;</p>
