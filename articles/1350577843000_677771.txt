<p>Jacob Brody, formerly MESA&#8217;s head of community and business development and now one of the fund&#8217;s three partners, told me that MESA+ plans to invest between $50,000 and $250,000 in rounds of between $500,000 and $5 million, and that it doesn&#8217;t intend to take any board seats.</p>
<p>What really differentiates the fund, Brody said, is its ability to connect startups to the media and entertainment industries. The investment bank&#8217;s vice president Andrew Montgomery, who&#8217;s also a partner in the fund, said that MESA (the name stands for Media &amp; Entertainment Strategy Advisors) has been helping entrepreneurs on this front for a while, but until it raised the new fund, &#8220;there was no business model for us to work with early-stage companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We understand both sides,&#8221; Brody said. &#8220;We can understand the entrepreneur&#8217;s side, as well as these larger corporations in the media and entertainment side larger businesses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of those larger corporations have actually invested in MESA+. The fund&#8217;s limited partners include publisher Conde Nast, digital media investor Saban Capital, and Sony Music. There&#8217;s also an LP advisory board that includes Michael Paull, executive vice president of global digital business at Sony Music, and Jonathan Miller, the former chief digital officer at News Corp.</p>
<p>MESA+ actually raised the fund and started investing several months ago, but Brody and his partners didn&#8217;t want to &#8220;launch&#8221; it until they had several investments under their belt. At this point it has already invested in seven companies — the publicly disclosed ones include <a target="_blank" href="http://www.republicproject.com">Republic Project</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.redtri.com">Red Tricycle</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bre.ad">Bre.ad</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.triplelift.com">TripleLift</a>.</p>
<p>The fund&#8217;s investments will focus on digital content, advertising, marketing, and commerce. The portfolio is currently spread out about half-and-half between New York and the West Coast, but Montgomery predicted that it will probably skew more heavily towards NYC.</p>
<p>By the way, Brody and I both used to write for VentureBeat, so I can say that he always seemed to know everyone on the startup scene, especially in New York. As far as I can tell, he wears nothing but startup T-shirts — though now that he&#8217;s an investor, Brody said he&#8217;s had to be a little more careful about wearing T-shirts advertising direct competitors to his portfolio companies.</p>
