So-called non-precinct voting has nearly doubled since 2000, rising from 14% to 28% in 2008. &#8220;It is clear that mail-in balloting faces administrative questions before we can be confident that it is as reliable as the in-person voting methods,&#8221; explains the Caltech-MIT Voting Technology Project report.</p>
<p>Mail-in ballots are a well-intentioned alternative to physical voting: it permits people in the military and overseas to participate, helps those who can&#8217;t get off work mid-week, and encourages lazy citizens with a low-effort procedure. However, a review of research on mail-in ballots <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bakerinstitute.org/publications/POL-pub-SteinVonnahmeELJPolling-100311.pdf">finds mixed results</a> on the actual impacts, with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/us/politics/as-more-vote-by-mail-faulty-ballots-could-impact-elections.html?pagewanted=all">fraud</a> a definite problem. <a target="_blank" href="http://weber.ucsd.edu/~tkousser/Will%20Vote-by-Mail%20Elections%20Increase%20Turnout.pdf">Experimental evidence</a> finds that mail-in voting can actually lower turnout by about 2.6%, except in special or less publicized elections, where it raises turnout by 7.6%.</p>
<p>Ironically, Obama&#8217;s administration <a target="_blank" href="http://whitehouse.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/15/first-lady-casts-early-ballot/">has pushed</a> early and mail-in voting, staging a photo-op as the first president (and first lady) in American history to mail in a ballot. It is even more ironic considering that Republicans are more likely to be mail-in voters. In 2008, 47% of Republicans were absentee voters, 36% were Democrats. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/us/politics/as-more-vote-by-mail-faulty-ballots-could-impact-elections.html?pagewanted=all">Florida is a bit of a special case</a>, however, where Republican officials have made it exceptionally easy to vote by mail-in. Democrats, the The <em>New York Times</em>, notes, are more likely to be early voters. Though, given that the election will be decided in just a few swing states, it is unclear whether the difficulty in mail-in voting will change the outcome of the election.</p>
<p>The real solution to the problem is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/08/tech/web/online-voting/index.html">Internet voting</a>, which the tiny technological powerhouse of Estonia has enjoyed since 2007. However, Estonia also has a national ID, which president Toomas Hendrik Illves has said is essential to secure, reliable government services.</p>
<p>Until then, it might behoove voters to put on some sunscreen, tie up their shoelaces, and go greet fellow voters in real life.</p>
