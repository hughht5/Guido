When the iPhone 4 first launched two years ago, quite a few users got devices that had <a target="_blank" href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/24/iphone-4s-yellow-spot-issue-goes-away-with-a-bit-of-time/">odd yellow spots</a> in some areas, for example. This time around, the issues are a bit more mysterious. Some iPhone 5s, for example, show an odd <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4kYbiygU6A">bubble effect</a> when their users press the screen too hard. Others report that their screens are flickering and are blurry in some areas.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear how widespread these issues are, but a number of videos that demonstrate these problems have now popped up on YouTube (via <a target="_blank" href="http://en.twitter.com/arnoldkim/status/249208856020930560">Arnold Kim</a>).</p>
<p>Here is an example of the odd bubble effect:</p>

<p>This user recorded how his phone&#8217;s screen flickers for no apparent reason:</p>

<p>And here is another example of the bubble effect:</p>

<p>On the <a target="_blank" href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1448953">MacRumors forum</a>, some users also complain about some backlight bleeding issues and <a target="_blank" href="https://discussions.apple.com/message/19668463#19668463">on Apple&#8217;s own forum</a>, at least one user complained about the fact that the lower part of his screen is blurry and another <a target="_blank" href="https://discussions.apple.com/message/19671870#19671870">reported</a> that his phone shows &#8220;a wavy line at the bottom and the top of the screen that is slightly discolored.&#8221;</p>
<p>We will obviously keep tracking this, but let us know if you are having similar issues with your new iPhone 5.</p>
