Ever since Microsoft distressed its desktop Windows OEMs by <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/18/will-the-microsoft-surface-tablet-redefine-mobile-computing/">unveiling its own-brand tablet PC, called Surface</a>, the logical leap required to imagine an own-brand Windows Phone has apparently been shrinking. But just because you can imagine a Surface Windows Phone, doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s about to be unboxed.</p>
<p>Microsoft itself has certainly not been encouraging this speculation. As recently as June, Windows Phone marketing manager, Greg Sullivan, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/25/microsoft-confirms-they-wont-be-making-their-own-windows-phones/">poured cold water on the suggestion</a> Redmond is planning to jump (<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/06/30/microsoft-puts-down-the-kin/">back</a>) into the phone hardware business. But of course that hasn&#8217;t stopped the rumour mill spinning. The latest speculation comes via the <a target="_blank" href="http://news.chinatimes.com/tech/171706/122012100100265.html?ystfuv">China Times</a>. The paper reports Microsoft has been working on a WP8 smartphone for several months with various assembly partners &#8212; and is expected to launch the &#8216;Surface Phone&#8217; device in the first half of 2013.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Microsoft for a response to this report and will update if we hear back.</p>
<p>The latest iteration of the Windows Phone OS, WP8, is due to land in a couple of weeks &#8212; and it&#8217;s backed by flagship smartphone launches from HTC, Nokia and Samsung. So you could say Microsoft has 99 <a target="_blank" href="http://my-symbian.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=44034">problems with Windows Phone</a> &#8212; and a selection of high end hardware isn&#8217;t one of them.</p>
<p>Building its own smartphone hardware, rather than working through existing partners, would be a strategy of last resort for Microsoft, IHS Screen Digest analyst Ian Fogg tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the Windows Phone 8 launch this autumn Microsoft is rightly relying on its strong mobile partners and their hardware and channel expertise,&#8221; he notes. &#8220;If Microsoft were to make its own Windows Phone device without working through partners, it would be a last resort strategy. That would risk driving its current partners away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alienating existing Windows Phone OEMs is the last thing Microsoft needs as it moves to reboot Windows Phone with the WP8 launch. The timing simply doesn&#8217;t make sense. The rumoured Microsoft-made WP8 device would make it yet another high end smartphone &#8212; meaning it would directly compete with already announced flagships (like Nokia&#8217;s Lumia 920 and Samsung&#8217;s Ativ S), rather than helping to broaden Window Phone&#8217;s reach, something <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/30/microsoft-needs-windows-phone-7-yes-7-not-wp8-to-win-significant-mobile-marketshare/">Microsoft needs to do to win significant share in the smartphone space</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/05/synaptics-behind-nokias-lumia-820-and-920-glove-and-fingernail-sensing-touchscreens/700-nokia-lumia-920-yellow-portrait/" rel="attachment wp-att-641171"></a>Microsoft&#8217;s record as a smartphone maker is dismal to say the least &#8212; and its brand does not therefore carry cachet with mobile users. Compare that to the mobile juggernaut that is Samsung with its Galaxy range of Android-based devices, or even Nokia, the former number one mobile maker which is still a huge brand in many markets, and a Microsoft logo is definitely not the &#8216;sprinkling of marketing magic&#8217; that Windows Phone is missing.</p>
<p>If seasoned and successful mobile makers like Nokia and Samsung are finding it tough to sell Windows Phones &#8212; with all their mobile expertise and established carrier relationships &#8212; Microsoft isn&#8217;t going to make WPs fly off the shelves by going it alone.</p>
<p>Of course, things might be different in a few years &#8212; if Redmond manages to make its nascent <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/18/hands-on-with-the-microsoft-surface-inside-and-out/">Surface tablet</a> fly, and build a strong ecosystem around the brand and Windows 8 apps, as Gartner analyst Roberta Cozza notes. But Surface success is something Microsoft still needs to work towards.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Microsoft already had some success in the tablet market &#8212; e.g. with Surface &#8212; and already had gathered quite a user base then having a smartphone probably could make some sense. But I don&#8217;t see now how Microsoft could, in a business like smartphones &#8212; where already more established device players are struggling &#8212; how the Microsoft brand could really make that connection,&#8221; Cozza tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be an enormous task, and I&#8217;m not sure where it would leave the OEMs that are investing in Windows Phone,&#8221; she adds. &#8220;If Microsoft alienates OEMs they could decrease focus on Windows Phone &#8212; when already we&#8217;re finding it&#8217;s the second choice [for most OEMs].&#8221;</p>
<p>So what then of this latest Surface Phone rumour coming out of China? It&#8217;s possible Microsoft has a back up plan to build its own Windows Phones in case its OEM partners fail to drive adoption in the coming years (or get tired of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/01/windows-phone-is-taking-share-from-rim-but-its-still-nowhere-near-breaking-through-the-androidios-stronghold-research/">trying</a>). Complex hardware products aren&#8217;t born in an instant &#8212; so Microsoft would need to start working on a phone now if it wanted to at least give itself the option of being able to launch something in a couple of years.</p>
<p>But right now Microsoft really needs to knuckle down and focus on Windows Phone software, not distract itself trying to build hardware. &#8221;One of the key reasons why Nokia has struggled [to sell its Lumia Windows Phones] is because Microsoft hasn&#8217;t improved Windows Phone over the last two years,&#8221; notes IHS Screen Digest&#8217;s Fogg &#8212; a charge he says can&#8217;t be levelled at WP&#8217;s competition, Android and iOS, now on versions 4.1 and version 6 respectively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Microsoft has key hardware partners behind them for Windows Phone,&#8221; Fogg adds. &#8220;At the moment it has to have a successful Windows Phone 8 launch&#8230; It would be crazy for them to do anything to damage those [OEM] relationships this autumn.&#8221;</p>
