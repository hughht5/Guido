The violation cost cost Microsoft billions in fines.</p>
<p>The complaint stems from how Microsoft has been implementing browser choice since it was first investigated over the issue years ago. The two sides reached a settlement in 2009 that detailed how Microsoft needed to offer users a clear alternative to Internet Explorer as the default internet browser when using the Windows platform in the future. At the time it also got fined over $2 billion for past violations.</p>
<p>But <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18873042">in June</a> of this year, it emerged that Microsoft had in fact violated the agreement: a version of Windows 7 that was distributed and activated 28 million times failed to offer users alternatives to IE.</p>
<p>Microsoft acknowledged the error when it first emerged, admitting that it had “fallen short” of expectations and that it had “deep regret” over the mistake. At the time, Joaquin Almunia, the current European Competition Commissioner, said: “We take compliance with our [original antitrust] decision very seriously. If the infringement is confirmed, there will be sanctions.”</p>
<p>More to come. Refresh for updates.</p>
