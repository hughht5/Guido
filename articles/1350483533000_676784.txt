Well, the Korean electronics giant has announced that it plans to begin to release the update in the U.S. in &#8220;the coming months,&#8221; and asked users to keep their collective eyes peeled for firmer dates from their carriers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not exactly a surprise to see domestic device owners get the shaft when it comes to these sorts of updates, and though I&#8217;m getting tired of companies trotting out the &#8220;coming months&#8221; line, carriers are likely to be the big bottleneck here.
