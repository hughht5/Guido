The recently freed Fabio Jose Silva Coelho is set for an undetermined court hearing after YouTube did not remove a salacious video allegedly revealing details of a mayoral candidate demanding her lover get an abortion. Since 1965, Brazil bans content that &#8220;offend the dignity or decorum&#8221; of the electoral process. &#8220;Google is appealing the decision that ordered the removal of the video on YouTube because, as a platform, Google is not responsible for the content posted to its site,&#8221; the company reports.</p>
<p>Brazil has also sided with a few Middle-Eastern and Asian nations in demanding that Google take down an <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/17/twitter-gives-muslims-a-voice-a-seriously-funny-voice-muslimrage/">offensive anti-Islamic</a>Â video responsible for deadly riots around the world. Google <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/17/why-google-shouldnt-have-censored-the-anti-islamic-video/">agreed to censor the video</a> in a few countries, such as Egypt and Libya, but not take it off the site and is (apparently) not taking it down in Brazil either.</p>
<p>The struggle highlights the growing struggle between self-expression, sovereignty, and the pervasiveness of technology.</p>
