The announcement comes just ahead of Sprint holding a conference call to also announce the news. In fact, this is turning out to be full acquisition of what Softbank is calling &#8220;New Sprint.&#8221;: &#8220;As a result of the transaction SOFTBANK will own approximately 70% of the fully-diluted (as used herein, not giving effect to out-of-the-money options) shares of New Sprint (as defined below), which will own 100% of the shares of Sprint.&#8221;</p>
<p>The news appears to have crashed the Sprint website. At least for now the site is only appearing in plain text and is taking time to load any updates, such as the link for the webcast to announce the news. That webcast is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ustream.tv/softbankcorp-eng">here</a>.</p>
<p>Softbank&#8217;s announcement lays out in some detail how the deal will work, and it confirms many of the facts from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/49408877">yesterday&#8217;s CNBC report</a>. Those noted that Softbank would buy $8 billion in shares from Sprint directly at $5.25 each; it would put out a tender for $12 billion of shares &#8212; this is actually going to be $12.1 billion, Softbank says &#8212; from shareholders at $7.30 a share (Sprint&#8217;s last trade on Friday was for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=sprint&amp;ei=w697UJCkDqiEwAOsTQ">$5.73/share</a>). <strong><br />

<p>More to come. Full announcement below.</p>
