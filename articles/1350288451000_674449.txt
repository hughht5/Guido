In fact, this is turning out to be full acquisition of what Softbank is calling &#8220;New Sprint.&#8221;: &#8220;As a result of the transaction SOFTBANK will own approximately 70% of the fully-diluted (as used herein, not giving effect to out-of-the-money options) shares of New Sprint (as defined below), which will own 100% of the shares of Sprint.&#8221; Softbank says that the combined company will be the world&#8217;s third largest in terms of revenues.</p>
<p>The news appears to have crashed the Sprint website. At least for now the site is only appearing in plain text and is taking time to load any updates, such as the link for the webcast (which it <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/14/while-you-were-sleeping-sprint-announces-special-webcast-for-4am-eastern-today-20b-softbank-investment-confirmed/">hastily announced at 2am Eastern time</a>) to announce the news. That webcast is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ustream.tv/softbankcorp-eng">here</a>.</p>
<p>Softbank&#8217;s announcement lays out in some detail how the deal will work, and it confirms many of the facts from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/49408877">yesterday&#8217;s CNBC report</a>. Those noted that Softbank would buy $8 billion in shares from Sprint directly at $5.25 each; it would put out a tender for $12 billion of shares &#8212; this is actually going to be $12.1 billion, Softbank says &#8212; from shareholders at $7.30 a share (Sprint&#8217;s last trade on Friday was for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=sprint&amp;ei=w697UJCkDqiEwAOsTQ">$5.73/share</a>). </p>
<p>Part of that $8 billion will include a $3.1 billion convertible bond, Softbank says.</p>
<p>The heads of Softbank and Sprint are currently holding a press conference in Japan covering the news. So far, Softbank&#8217;s CEO Masayoshi Son has made a big argument for synergies between the two companies. Now Dan Hesse, Sprint&#8217;s CEO, is talking about how Sprint&#8217;s number-three position in the market. &#8220;It&#8217;s number one in terms of revenue and ARPU growth,&#8221; he&#8217;s noted. </p>
<p>Hesse is also making a big play in terms of how Sprint is looking forward, and trying to put a lot of its legacy business (that includes its push-to-talk IDEN network, and that WiMax) behind it. &#8220;We are entering an investment phase at Sprint,&#8221; he said. Network Vision, its massive upgrade plan, should be completed by 2014, and Softbank in its announcement on the deal notes that its $8 billion direct share purchase will help Sprint complete that strategy (largely in the form of that $3.1 billion convertible bond).</p>
<p>More to come. Full announcement below.</p>
