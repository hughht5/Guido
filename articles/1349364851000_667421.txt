Social news readers, for example, broadcast the articles you read to your Facebook friends, and led to embarrassment as users caught themselves auto-sharing content they would rather not admit to. The experience was bad enough that, this May, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/31/facebook-auto-sharing/">Facebook finally cracked down on auto-sharing apps</a> by implementing a 10-second rule before sharing took place.</p>
<p>Now, a company called <a target="_blank" href="http://janrain.com/">Janrain</a> is offering an alternative to Facebook&#8217;s own implementation of auto-sharing. Built on top of Facebook&#8217;s Open Graph technology, Janrain&#8217;s one-click sharing mechanism offers users more control over their sharing behaviors. And one of the first companies to adopt the tool is TMZ &#8211; a site no one wants to be busted auto-sharing content from.</p>
<p>The Oregon-based startup Janrain is best known for leading development on the open, federated identity technology known as <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID">OpenID</a>. Last summer, the company <a target="_blank" href="http://gigaom.com/2011/08/02/janrain/">raised</a> $15.5 million in funding to continue work on its social software solutions, which includes a social login tool inspired by its work on OpenID.</p>
<p>With Janrain&#8217;s new social sharing tool for publishers, users can toggle auto-sharing on or off at any time, and when it&#8217;s on, each story they read will also feature a countdown timer which indicates how many more seconds they have before the story is auto-shared to Facebook. Brands can choose how long the delay for that timer should be, too. The idea of a delay is not remarkably different from Facebook&#8217;s own solution, but the visible timer is. It allows for a more transparent relationship between publisher and reader, which could then, in turn, mean fewer readers end up feeling like they were &#8220;tricked&#8221; into sharing content. When auto-sharing is switched off, readers still have the option of sharing stories individually, much like how the Facebook share buttons operate today.</p>

<p>In addition, once the story has been posted to a user&#8217;s Facebook timeline, any user who then clicks the link is taken directly to the website itself &#8211; not to some sort of social news reading app on Facebook, which was one of the other <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/19/curation-through-unsharing/">complaints</a> users had about the way frictionless sharing was implemented on Facebook. Friends clicking the link offered by Janrain&#8217;s solution aren&#8217;t opted into auto-sharing, they don&#8217;t have to grant an app permissions, and they don&#8217;t have to view an ad &#8211; they&#8217;re just taken to the article.</p>
<p>While Janrain&#8217;s social login solution is now used by over 350,000 websites, this auto-sharing tool is new, and there&#8217;s not a large lineup of launch partners at this time. But one notable implementation will be found on celeb gossip site TMZ. That makes sense, because arguably that&#8217;s exactly the sort of site where users don&#8217;t necessarily want to auto-share content. The auto-sharing tool is available now as a feature in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.janrain.com/">Janrain&#8217;s User Management Platform</a> (JUMP), which includes products for social login, profile data storage, registration, and single sign-on.</p>
