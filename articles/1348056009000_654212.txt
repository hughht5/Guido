First, the company is launching Salesforce Touch, which is powered by HTML5, and brings Salesforce to any mobile device, allowing reps to collaborate on sales deals on the go. The company is also debuting a Data.com Social Key that will provide a link between contact data and social networks. And lastly, Salesforce is creating Chatter communities for the Service Cloud.</p>
<p>Salesforce Touch allows employees to enter, access and collaborate around data in Salesforce via an HTML5 app optimized for tablets and phones including iPhone, iPad and Android devices. Sales reps can log follow up action items after a meeting, uncover information to prepare for an important presentation, or get an approval needed to move a deal forward via the app.</p>
<p>Salesforce is debuting Chatter Communities for Partners, which allows companies to create multiple private, branded communities for organizations to communicate with vendors. Companies, along with their partners, suppliers and distributors, will be able to create custom communities to drive more sales through deal registration, access to proven sales tools and collaboration with the right experts.</p>
<p>Salesforce&#8217;s Data.com allows customers fill in the missing holes about contact and account data in the Sales Cloud. Today, the company is releasing a new feature, the Social Key, which allows customers to harness real-time public social data from Twitter, blogs and YouTube videos, and link this to traditional data like employers and phone numbers. The Data.com Social Key is currently scheduled to be generally available the second half of 2013.</p>
<p>Additionally, Salesforce is debuting Chatter Communities for Service for the service cloud, which is a branded location where an organization&#8217;s customers can ask questions, find answers, and receive help from other community members and from the company directly. Chatter Communities for Service is scheduled to be available in limited pilot in Fall 2012, and generally available the second half of 2013.</p>
