As the Japanese manufacturer of cameras, optics and reprography products is currently facing a trial for <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/08/448899/">having hidden investment losses</a> for the past 20 years, it has been looking for a potential investor for months. By injecting that capital investment, Sony will become the largest shareholder.</p>
<p>After rumors of a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/08/panasonic-ceo-no-plans-to-invest-630m-into-olympus/">Panasonic investment</a> in June, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/25/us-sony-olympus-idUSBRE88O0AE20120925">Reuters</a> confirmed from three different sources that Sony and Olympus are ready to announce an investment that would represent 10 percent of the capital.</p>
<p>Olympus reported a net loss of $630 million (49 billion yen) for the last fiscal year, mainly due to wrong financial decisions and the repercussions of the past <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/07/down-from-olympus-whats-going-on-at-the-beleaguered-camera-company/">scandalous affair</a>. Today, the company and three former high-ranking executives pleaded guilty. Over a couple of decades, around $1.7 billion of losses were faked.</p>
<p>Olympus announced in June that it would cut 2,700 jobs and scrap 40 percent of its factories in order to reduce costs. Last quarter, the company reported a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/09/olympus-earnings-idUST9E8I901G20120809">60 percent drop</a> in operating profit.</p>
<p>With that investment, Sony will become the largest shareholder, and the two companies will create a new business unit focused on medical equipment. As a brand-new market for Sony, it is a way to diversify its revenue.</p>
<p>Yet, last quarter, despite $19.2 billion in sales, Sony&#8217;s operating profit was down 77 percent to only $79 million. Standard &amp; Poor&#8217;s downgraded Sony, as well, which could make investment more difficult in the future.</p>
<p>As Vic Gundotra said in <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/02/09/nokia-microsoft/">another situation</a>, &#8220;two turkeys do not make an eagle.&#8221; When it comes to Japanese investments, they are often hard to understand for a foreigner. Two companies following a downward trend won&#8217;t find an easy solution by partnering. It remains to be seen if they can now focus on producing innovative new products.</p>
