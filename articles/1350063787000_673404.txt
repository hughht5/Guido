<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.bmocm.com/">BMO Capital Markets</a> said the market potential for social business software is large and they believe Jive has the best product, but there is a cold reality that market enthusiasm is waning to some degree. Here&#8217;s what they said in a statement today:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;However, our checks this week suggest that the market has moved past the initial hype and early adopter phase, that the next round of corporate buyers are taking a more sober look at the ROI from social platforms, and that the likelihood of upside to the Street&#8217;s billings growth estimates for Jive in 2H12 is lower. If we&#8217;re right that the tipping point is at least a few more quarters out, we conclude that Jive shares are more likely to tread water at the mid- teens level than to rally sharply back into the $20-$25 range.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Jive&#8217;s stock price is hovering around $13 per share, its lowest prices since its IPO last year. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/13/jive-softwares-shares-pop-27-percent-on-first-trade-valued-at-over-800-million/">Leena Rao</a> wrote at the time that on the eve of its initial trading, the company priced its IPO at <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/12/enterprise-software-company-jive-prices-ipo-at-12-per-share-valued-at-over-600m/">$12 per share</a>, giving the company a $600 million-plus valuation. Jive originally set the range between <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/30/jive-sets-price-range-for-ipo-at-8-to-10-per-share-valued-at-over-500m/">$8 and $10 per share.</a> On that December day, it opened at $15.12 per share, up 27 percent from its pricing.</p>
<p>This makes for some interesting market dynamics as vendors compete for attention from a more fickle customer base. It raises questions about what customers really want and need.  Vendors now offer a choice of lightweight, cloud-based services, on-premise solutions or a combination of both. But it&#8217;s questionable if the market offerings we see today really serves customers&#8217;s needs.  The market&#8217;s reaction today proves that in many respects.</p>
<p>Customers want proof that social technologies have value across the organization. They want social technologies that become part of their work.  Too often,  enterprise social networks act as a separate silo where people interact for the sake of using a social media solution. That needs to change. We&#8217;ll see that change happen over the next year as more vendors recognize it&#8217;s more about making the job easier to do than a &#8220;like&#8221; button or the novelty of s Twitter like activity stream.</p>
