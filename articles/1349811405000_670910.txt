<p>It&#8217;s been less than two years since Verizon first lit up its 4G LTE network, and there&#8217;s little question that its been growing at a quick clip (especially when compared to its rivals). According to a statement delivered by Verizon Wireless CTO Nicola Palmer at MobileCON in San Diego, the carrier will light up its 400th LTE market &#8212; Marquette, Michigan &#8212; on October 18, well ahead of the &#8220;end of the year&#8221; timeframe the carrier previously forecasted.</p>
<p>Of course, the network&#8217;s speedy growth wasn&#8217;t without its share of hiccups &#8212; VZW customers may recall that a string of nationwide LTE outages toward the end of last year made holiday gadget buying and network usage problematic. </p>
<p>Palmer also said that a full 35% of the carrier&#8217;s wireless data traffic was sent over its 4G LTE network, but that should change sooner rather than later. She also mentioned that &#8220;it wouldn&#8217;t be long&#8221; before a majority of that data would be transmitted over LTE.</p>
