November 2 is the ship date we&#8217;ve heard today from a source close to Apple&#8217;s supply chain, echoing an earlier report by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.geeky-gadgets.com/exclusive-ipad-mini-release-date-is-november-2nd-17-10-2012/">Geeky Gadgets</a> that that&#8217;s the day the iPad mini will go on sale.</p>
<p>Geeky Gadgets cited a prominent U.K. retailer as the source of its information. For the iPhone 5, the <a title="More Evidence For September 21 Ship Date For iPhone 5" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/07/more-evidence-for-september-21-ship-date-for-iphone-5/">September 21 retail availability date was telegraphed ahead of time</a> thanks to leaked information from carrier partners, and retailers have been a source of Apple-related product leaks in the past. Our own source has also previously proven reliable with unreleased Apple info.</p>
<p>In addition to our own source and Geeky Gadgets, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/9to5mac/status/258552702538240000">9to5Mac also tweeted</a> that it was hearing this was the date it would be released and likely hit the first batch of pre-order buyers. It&#8217;s also the most logical choice, given Apple&#8217;s recent product announcement and release timelines. For the iPhone 5, Apple announced it on September 12, with pre-orders beginning on September 14 and devices shipping and hitting retail stores September 21. Pre-orders for the latest iPad started immediately following its announcement, and the iPad actually shipped only nine days later, however, so it isn&#8217;t yet clear whether the iPad mini&#8217;s pre-order date will be the same day as the announcement, or the Friday following, and our source had no information in that area.</p>
<p>Apple also probably wants to take full advantage of the holiday shopping season, so pushing for availability following closely on the heels of the announcement is a good bet. Traditionally, it enjoys considerable success during the holiday period. Apple sold <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/24/apples-q1-2012-46-3b-in-revenue-37m-iphones-and-15-4m-ipads-sold/">15.43 million iPads during last year&#8217;s holiday quarter</a>, up from <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/18/apple-q1-2011/">7.33 million in the same period in 2011</a>. It managed an impressive <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/24/apple-q3-2012-26m-iphones-17m-ipads-4m-macs-and-6-8m-ipods/">17 million during the quarter ending June 30, 2012</a>, however, so it could be poised for record-shattering quarter this holiday, if the iPad mini strikes a chord with users in terms of price and design.</p>
