<p>Details on Puhlmann&#8217;s supposed departure are scarce at the moment, and we&#8217;ll update this story with more information we receive. When contacted this morning, a representative for Zynga declined to issue a confirmation or denial, and said the company was &#8220;not commenting&#8221; on the matter. </p>
<p>This is the latest in a slew of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/zynga-departures-now-an-exodus-2012-09-10">high-profile departures</a> from the San Francisco-based online gaming giant, which in recent weeks has lost its <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/08/coo-john-schappert-leaves-zynga/">COO John Schappert</a>, infrastructure CTO <a target="_blank" href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/09/10/allan-leinwand-zynga-servicenow/">Allan Leiwand</a>, chief creative officer <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/28/chief-creative-officer-mike-verdu-leaves-zynga-to-found-new-zynga-backed-startup/">Mike Verdu</a>, and chief marketing and revenue officer <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/10/zynga-jeff-karp/">Jeff Karp</a>, among others. Zynga has had a rocky road on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/finance?client=ob&amp;q=NASDAQ:ZNGA">stock market</a> since its initial public offering <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/16/zynga-shares-pop-10-percent-to-11-on-first-trade-valued-at-7-7-billion/">late last year</a>; its stock opened this morning with a share price of $3.09, down significantly from its $10 IPO price.</p>
<p>One thing that&#8217;s for sure is that Puhlmann is a very seasoned expert in the security space, having spent more than 15 years in executive-level security roles at software and web firms including Adobe, Electronic Arts, Mindjet, and Qualys. In the months leading up to Zynga&#8217;s IPO, he was <a target="_blank" href="http://vator.tv/news/2011-07-01-zyngas-ipo-made-possible-by-the-zynga-dream-team">described in the press</a> as a core member of the company&#8217;s executive &#8220;dream team.&#8221; One source tells me that Puhlmann &#8220;was able to build one of the strongest security teams in the San Francisco area, and, in my opinion, the strongest in all of the gaming industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Puhlmann&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://code.zynga.com/nils-puhlmann/">official bio at Zynga</a> describes his role there thusly:</p>
