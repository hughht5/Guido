Such a system could potentially allow an iPhone, iPad or any portable device to build up a charge as a user moves around, giving up a continual source of extra juice that should at the very least ensure that you never run completely dry while on the go.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, this kind of technology is so large that it would be hard to imagine it fitting into a sleek shell, like the thin and light design of the new iPhone 5. That&#8217;s where this <a target="_blank" href="http://www.unwiredview.com/2012/09/20/an-iphone-that-charges-when-you-walk-via-electromagnetic-induction-apple-is-looking-into-it/">unique design comes in</a>, since it offers a method for printing coils in the same way that circuit boards are printed, in dense layers that, when paired with a signal moveable magnet array, could theoretically generate the same kind of electromagnetic charge as, for example, the machine in the YouTube video below.</p>
<p>There are plenty of devices that use similar methods for power creation, including flashlights and some <a target="_blank" href="http://www.seikowatches.com/technology/kinetic/index.html">quartz wristwatches</a>. But Apple&#8217;s method is clearly aimed at making it possible for this tech to work with smartphones and other mobile gadgets, and could theoretically work either as contained system or as a two-part arrangement in which the magnet portion could live in a holster, case or other device to reduce the necessary bulk. It also doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to make iPhone self-powered – a small array that provides enough juice to slowly feed back some charge and thus extend battery life considerably throughout the day would provide considerable benefit, even if it can&#8217;t fully charge the device in any reasonable amount of time.</p>
<p>While motion-powered charging for devices as power-hungry as the iPhone still might seem a long way off, there are reasons to believe that Apple might be thinking about this problem as a more immediate concern. First, it seems obvious that the company is looking for ways to maximize its device battery life, as evidenced by it <a title="The iPhone 5′s Greatest Inside Story: Chipmaking Maturation For Apple" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/18/the-iphone-5s-greatest-inside-story-chipmaking-maturation-for-apple/">taking the reins on the A6 chip design</a>. Second, a <a target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303544604576429292482910586.html">WSJ report </a>from last year that detailed a lot of accurate information about the iPhone 4S also said that Apple was &#8220;experimenting&#8221; with new features including new methods for charging, for inclusion in future phone models.</p>
<p>Of course, Apple also patents a lot of things, not all of which make it to shipping products. But an iPhone or iPad that powers itself would definitely be a feature addition that would stand out from the increasingly crowded smartphone and tablet race.</p>
