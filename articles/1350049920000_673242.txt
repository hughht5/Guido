Now Cupertino has agreed to license the design from SBB (h/t to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/12/3492896/apple-sbb-licensing-agreement-ios-6-clock-app">Verge</a> for spotting <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sbb.ch/sbb-konzern/medien/medienmitteilungen.newsdetail.2012-10-1210_1.html">SBB&#8217;s release</a>).</p>
<p>The release notes that Apple and SBB have reached an agreement to license the design &#8220;for use on devices like iPad and iPhone&#8221;. Further terms of the deal &#8212; such as how much Apple is paying SBB to use its design &#8212; have not been disclosed. An SBB spokeswoman said: &#8220;The parties have agreed that the amount of the licensing fee and any further details of the licensing arrangement will remain confidential.&#8221;</p>
<p>The licensing deal with Apple is only the third the company has entered into for the clock design &#8212; its other licensing deals are with Mondaine, which manufactures SBB-watches, and Mobatime, which produces and maintains the official clocks at SBB&#8217;s train stations.</p>
<p>The original Swiss Railway Clock was designed in 1944 by engineer and designer Hans Hilfiker. Notable features include the use of marks rather than numbers around the dial, and a striking red second hand.</p>
