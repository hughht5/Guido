You&#8217;re tired of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/23/heres-what-goes-into-making-google-maps-will-apple-be-able-to-recalculate/">hearing about Apple Maps in iOS 6</a>, but it&#8217;s a hot topic. Because of it, Google is being discussed in the news more and more. The fruits of that labor is now reflected in its <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ%3AGOOG&amp;ei=xJpgUOjyBuqkiQLDLQ">stock price</a>, which has surged to an all-time high of $747.90.</p>
<p>Does this Apple Maps thing have anything to do with it? Probably not directly, but as people look for places to put their money, it&#8217;s safe to say that Google Maps making news lately certainly doesn&#8217;t hurt the bottom line for the search giant.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/24/google-stock-at-an-all-time-high-did-apple-help-them-out/snapshot-92412-1037-am/" rel="attachment wp-att-658232"></a></p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=apple&amp;ei=DpxgUKi_LKaoiAL6UA">Apple stock is currently down</a> $15.93. That also has a lot to do with Apple &#8220;missing&#8221; analyst expectations on iPhone 5 sales, which I think is a load of bunk.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m certainly no stock expert, but it doesn&#8217;t take a rocket scientist to know that once your company and products start getting discussed a lot, people are going to take notice. Google Maps is a superior product to one that just got launched as part of the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/21/watch-apples-first-iphone-5-tv-ads-physics-cheese-thumb-and-ears/">biggest campaign by Apple yet, the iPhone 5</a>.</p>
<p>Will this stock price stick for Google? It&#8217;s still early on a Monday, so my guess is&#8230;yes. As these two companies continue going toe-to-toe, these kinds of fluctuations will be increasingly more interesting in the future.</p>
