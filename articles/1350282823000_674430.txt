It follows yesterday&#8217;s news that Japanese carrier and tech investor Softbank will be buying a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.techmeme.com/121014/p10#a121014p10">70% stake in Sprint</a> for $20 billion. Sprint confirmed last week that it was in strategic discussions with Softbank.</p>
<p>The deal would mean that Softbank would be the third big non-U.S. investor in a major U.S. carrier &#8212; the others being Vodafone&#8217;s 45% stake of Verizon Wireless and Deutsche Telekom&#8217;s full ownership of T-Mobile USA.</p>
<p>The statement doesn&#8217;t reveal anything about what today&#8217;s call will be about. For those interested, you need to visit Sprint&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://newsroom.sprint.com/news/">newsroom</a> five minutes before to get the link to the webcast. &#8220;For those unable to view at this time, replays will be available.&#8221;</p>
