The news appeared in a letter from Joel Weinberger, CEO of Insolvency Services Group.</p>
<p>OnLive <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/19/onlive-sold-to-onlive-and-nothing-will-change-heartbreaking-transition-notwithstanding/">sold itself to itself</a> in a clever financial maneuver last August and is now a new company using the OnLive brand and IP &#8211; and customer list. As of today the organization is still offering gaming service. Wolverton notes that this deal was the &#8220;best that OnLive could get&#8221;.</p>
<p>The company said in an August release the &#8220;OnLive partnerships, are expected to continue without interruption and all customer purchases will remain intact; users are not expected to notice any change whatsoever.&#8221;</p>
<p>OnLive streams video games over the network to various devices including consoles and computers. The subscription-based service allowed users to access and play multiple games at high resolution while all processing occurred in the company&#8217;s server farm.</p>
