Even worse, IOActive researcher Barnaby Jack says that it would be &#8220;100 percent possible&#8221; that virus could spread to other devices in a wave of &#8220;mass murder&#8221;. The transparently over-the-top scenario was performed in the convenience of a controlled conference setting, but it does come on the heels of a National Institute of Standards and Technology conference <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19979936">where panelists</a> warned of common computer malware infecting hospital devices.</p>
<p>At the BreakPoint security conference in Melbourne Jack demonstrated that he could reverse engineer a pacemaker to deliver fatal shocks from within 30 feet and rewrite the devices onboard software (firmware). The pacemaker also contained a &#8220;secret function&#8221; that could activate other cardiac devices within a 30 foot-plus vicinity.</p>
<p>“The worst case scenario that I can think of, which is 100 percent possible with these devices, would be to load a compromised firmware update onto a programmer and … the compromised programmer would then infect the next pacemaker or ICD [implantable cardioverter-defibrillators] and then each would subsequently infect all others in range.”</p>
<p>Jack said that he was developing a graphical platform, &#8220;Electric Feel,&#8221; which could activate the deadly protocol with a mere right-click. This is not the first time hacking vulnerabilities to pacemakers have been exposed; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2008-03/could-your-pacemaker-be-hacked">in 2008</a>, researchers from the University of Washington and Massachusetts assumed control of a pacemaker and stole data.</p>
<p>Hacking devices in the world may prove to be considerably more difficult, but it highlights the an overlooked field in need of security: healthcare.</p>
<p>&#8220;Imagine you have a heart monitor that&#8217;s running Windows and it gets infected by a computer virus and slows down,&#8221; University of Michigan computer scientist, Kevin Fu, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19979936">warned</a> the BBC. Fu, who was speaking a medical conference, said that the Food and Drug Administration needed to require security protocols in addition to safety regulation.</p>
<p>While there have been no documented criminal attempts at infiltration, his panel agreed that precaution should be a priority.</p>
