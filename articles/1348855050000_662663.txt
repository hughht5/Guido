Microsoft is calling this one a &#8220;fun surprise,&#8221; but it could actually be a very helpful convenience feature in helping developers understand their audience.</p>
<p>A lot of developers I&#8217;ve spoken with have had success in markets where English isn&#8217;t the primary language, despite no efforts to localize on their part. A quick and easy way to understand what it is people like about the app in those areas where performance is surging (or flopping badly), without having to go to Google Translate and manually input content, could make it easier to translate success to other markets or correct failures.</p>
<p>This is a small feature addition, but one that reflects a growing need for Microsoft and others fighting for third place in the smartphone platform wars to cater to developers in as many ways as they possibly can.</p>
