Facebook revealed today that half of its iOS users updated their app in just 4 days, and now 3 weeks later its App Store review average has risen from 1.5 stars to 4 stars. Mobile product manager Mick Johnson talked to a crew of reporters at Facebook HQ today, echoing <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/zuckerberg-the-leader/">CEO Mark Zuckerberg&#8217;s TechCrunch Disrupt talk</a>, saying that iOS users with the update now consumer twice as many news feed stories, and that means twice as many opportunities to show them news feed ads.</p>
<p>Johnson discussed the mistake of building Facebook&#8217;s mobile apps around HTML5, saying &#8220;When we embedded it in our native apps, the performance wasn&#8217;t what our users expected or what were were happy with either. The features were there but it didn&#8217;t feel like the experience we wanted to use, that wanted to build.&#8221; He still says &#8220;I&#8217;m long-term bullish on HTLM5 for everything&#8221; indicating Facebook may come back to HTML5 once it improves, and will continue relying on it to reach the long-tail of mobile, especially abroad.</p>
<p>The slowness of launching the app, browsing the feed, and viewing photos were dragging down its review, but also frustrating users such that they&#8217;d exit the app prematurely or not open it when they only had a moment. That meant less content being generated, less notifications that drive return visits being sent, and less time spent viewing the news feed. Since Facebook is trying to become a mobile advertising company and those ads are shown in the news feed, slowness translated into missing revenue.</p>
<p>Johnson say now the Facebook iOS app feels much more alive. I feel it too. I&#8217;m more likely to whip out Facebook when I&#8217;m standing in line at a cafe or a spare 30 seconds somewhere else, not just when I know I have a multiple minutes to wait for it to load up the news feed. Those extra sessions let Facebook serve me more ads about Pages my friends have Liked or apps they&#8217;re using.</p>
<p>The feedbackF receiving has changed. Before people simply demanded the app get faster, now they&#8217;re essentially saying it works well, but here&#8217;s the new features they want. That fresh insight will help Facebook keep improving the app. In fact, Johnson said Facebook is now moving to a two week release cycle for iOS and a one month cycle for Android.</p>
