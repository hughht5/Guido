France&#8217;s data protection authority, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cnil.fr/">Commission Nationale de l&#8217;Informatique (CNIL)</a>, today published a list of 12 &#8220;practical recommendations&#8221; for the company in the area of user privacy, following an investigation that began earlier this year.</p>
<p>Because the European Union acts in a &#8220;harmonized&#8221; way, those recommendations have been endorsed already by data protection commissioners in several other countries. In all, some 29 regulators have backed the recommendations, including non-EU members Croatia and Lichtenstein. This is actually the first time that all of them have backed a single policy like this.</p>
<p>The investigation was sparked after Google changed its privacy policy in March, combining some 60 different policies across its different online services &#8212; search, Gmail, YouTube, Google+, and more &#8212; into a single user privacy agreement. Google currently does not give users an option to opt out of that policy.</p>
<p>In Europe, some of Google&#8217;s practices are actually running afoul of existing regulations, so the practical recommendations point to this area. (These, it should be pointed out, were leaked to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/15/us-eu-dataprotection-idUSBRE89E0YD20121015">Reuters</a> yesterday.)</p>
<p>In a press conference today, Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin of the CNIL presented the findings and recommendations to Google: they include suggesting making it clearer to users how their personal information &#8212; that includes location data and credit card data &#8212; may be used.</p>
<p>The recommendations also cover actions that speak to Google&#8217;s core business: advertising. It suggests that Google needs to better explain to users how their data is collected from different services and collated. Google, like many others working in online advertising, are looking for ways of better targeting ads to users, and part of the way that they do this is by monitoring your web activity and then serving ads that are relevant based on that. Companies like Google have always maintained that they use anonymized data when doing this, but the fact remains that your data continues to be mined.</p>
<p>We are reaching out to Google for comment and will continue to update this story as the press conference progresses. Refresh for updates.</p>
