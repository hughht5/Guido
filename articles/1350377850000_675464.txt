But they also stopped short of saying Google is acting illegally in how it manages privacy. France&#8217;s data protection authority, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cnil.fr/">Commission Nationale de l&#8217;Informatique (CNIL)</a>, today published a list of recommendations for the company in the area of user privacy, following an investigation that began earlier this year.</p>
<p>Google has three to four months to comply with these recommendations; otherwise it may face sanctions. Quite possibly that might also lead to escalated investigations.</p>
<p>Because the European Union acts in a &#8220;harmonized&#8221; way, those recommendations have been endorsed by data protection commissioners in several other countries. In all, some 29 regulators have backed the recommendations, including non-EU members Croatia and Lichtenstein. This is actually the first time that all of them have backed a single policy like this, the CNIL noted in the press conference today.</p>
<p>The investigation was sparked after Google <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/24/google-consolidates-privacy-policy-will-combine-user-data-across-services/">changed its privacy policy</a>, completing the process in March and combining some 60 different policies across its different online services &#8212; search, Gmail, YouTube, Google+, and more &#8212; into a single user privacy agreement. Google currently does not give users an easy option to opt out of that policy.</p>
<p>In Europe, some of Google&#8217;s practices are actually running afoul of existing regulations, so the practical recommendations point to this area. (These, it should be pointed out, were leaked to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/15/us-eu-dataprotection-idUSBRE89E0YD20121015">Reuters</a> yesterday.)</p>
<p>In a press conference today, Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin of the CNIL presented the findings and recommendations to Google: they include suggesting making it clearer to users how their personal information &#8212; that includes location data and credit card data &#8212; may be used.</p>
<p>The recommendations largely relate to actions that speak to Google&#8217;s core business: advertising. It suggests that Google needs to better explain to users how their data is collected from different services and collated, and provide a way to opt out of this if a user chooses to do so.</p>
<p>Google, like many others working in online advertising, is looking for ways to better target ads to users, and part of the way that they do this is by monitoring your web activity and then serving ads that are relevant based on that. Companies like Google have always maintained that they use anonymized data when doing this, but the fact remains that your data continues to be mined.</p>
<p>The implications of this, of course, go much wider than Google, although since Google currently is the biggest of the internet companies making money from online ads, it is the most obvious target.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how Google reacts to this report. Again, they company has not been accused of any illegal activities, and it has four months it seems to put in some changes. Today&#8217;s recommendations therefore could be a first step in getting Google to change its practices before the scrutiny does reach higher levels of enforceability.</p>
<p>And although there is no legal rider today, that doesn&#8217;t mean that the recommendations will not result in action from Google. Last month, Facebook had its own run-in with data protection authorities &#8212; in its case in Ireland, where it too was given &#8220;recommendations&#8221; for changes to put in place with its privacy policy. There, Facebook has worked with the DPA to implement those changes covering how users can access and delete their Facebook data, and going so far as to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/21/facebook-turns-off-facial-recognition-in-the-eu-gets-the-all-clear-from-irelands-data-protection-commissioner-on-its-review/">even (temporarily) shelve its Tag Suggest feature</a> to automatically identify and tag faces in photos.</p>
<p>We are reaching out to Google for comment and will continue to update this story as the press conference progresses. Refresh for updates.</p>
