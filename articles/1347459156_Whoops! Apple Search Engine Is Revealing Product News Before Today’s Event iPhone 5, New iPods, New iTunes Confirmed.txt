As spotted first by the folks at <a target="_blank" href="http://9to5mac.com/2012/09/12/whoops-iphone-5-name-seems-to-be-confirmed-by-apple-coms-search-engine">9to5</a>, a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/search/?q=iPhone-5&amp;section=global&amp;geo=us">search for “iPhone-5</a> on Apple’s website indicates that is, indeed, what&#8217;s happening today. And yep, looks like they&#8217;re calling it the iPhone 5, not &#8220;the new iPhone.&#8221; We&#8217;ve also found <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/search/?q=2012%2F09%2F12Apple">a link </a>that indicates a new version of iTunes is being announced as well, again confirming rumors.</p>
<p>The search results also point to a new iPod Touch and iPod Nano, which is less exciting in our opinion, but still a notable leak.</p>
