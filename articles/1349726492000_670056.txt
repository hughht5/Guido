<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.zynga.com/2012/10/08/cityville-2-coming-soon/">company blog post</a> doesn&#8217;t offer too many details about the game itself, beyond saying &#8220;It has all the features in CityVille that players love – from neighbor visits and crews to buildables – blended with some of the innovations we introduced in CastleVille and FarmVille 2 like crafting and 3D graphics.&#8221; (You can get a preview of the aforementioned graphics in the image at the top of this post.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also hearing that the initial test will be limited to the Philippines. That seems to mirror Zynga&#8217;s strategy for FarmVille 2, which was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/11/zyngas-next-cash-cow-farmville-sequel-spotted-under-the-name-big-harvest/">spotted earlier this year under the name &#8220;Big Harvest&#8221;</a>  in, yes, the Philippines, before <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/05/zynga-finally-debuts-farmville-2-promises-to-keep-working-on-the-original-too/">getting its full launch in September</a>. The difference is that Zynga is publicizing the test this time, rather than hiding it under a fake name.</p>
<p>The announcement comes after a rough week for Zynga, when the company <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/04/zynga-lowers-outlook-for-2012-q3-cites-weakness-in-certain-games-including-the-ville/">cut its revenue outlook for 2012</a>, leading to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/04/zynga-after-hours/">a big drop in share price</a> and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/05/more-competitors-smarter-gamers-expensive-ads-less-virality-mobile/">at least one big think piece</a> about where the company went wrong. To counteract the weakness of its &#8220;invest and express&#8221; games, <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.zynga.com/2012/10/04/ceo-update/">CEO Mark Pincus said</a> Zynga will be &#8220;further investing in other genres like casino where we already lead with Zynga Poker and blue PVP, a category we pioneered with Mafia Wars.&#8221;</p>
<p>It looks like that shift doesn&#8217;t mean Zynga is abandoning the franchises that it&#8217;s known for. CityVille famously surpassed FarmVille as Zynga&#8217;s most popular game back in 2010, and it was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/21/facebook-top-games/">one of the top Facebook games last year</a> (on a pure numbers basis, it seemed like it should have been ranked No. 1). <a target="_blank" href="http://www.appdata.com/apps/facebook/291549705119-cityville">According to AppData</a>, it currently has 2.2 million daily active users and 16.8 monthly active users.</p>
