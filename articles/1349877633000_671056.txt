Until now, the service was only available in the <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maluuba.android">U.S., Australia, UK and Ireland</a>, but the International Edition is now available worldwide in the Google Play store. As part of this launch, Maluuba is also now featured in the Appia-powered Vodafone store.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: the <a target="_blank" href="http://maluu.ba/downloadintl">international version</a> is only available outside of the U.S., Canada, the UK and Australia. You can <a target="_blank" href="http://maluu.ba/intldownload">download the full version</a> if you live in one of these countries.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/10/android-based-siri-competitor-maluuba-goes-international-looks-to-raise-up-to-10m/unnamed-4-3/" rel="attachment wp-att-671202"></a>As Maluuba&#8217;s CEO and co-founder Sam Pasupalak told me earlier this week, the company is in the process of raising a new round of funding. In total, the company hopes to raise somewhere between $8 million and $10 million and plans to use this money to expand its team. Maluuba previously raised $2 million from Samsung Ventures.</p>
<p>The reason Maluuba decided to launch a special International Edition of its app instead of just making its current app available in different countries is because its service depends on a large number of local content partners. Many of these, however, aren&#8217;t available everywhere (think Yelp, for example) and the user experience isn&#8217;t very good without reliable access to partner content. Since its launch, Maluuba saw a lot of international demand for its app and Pasupalak noted that the service has users all around the world, despite the fact that the app isn&#8217;t available outside of the company&#8217;s three core markets.</p>
<p>For the time being, Maluuba only understands English, but the team plans to expand the range of supported languages by early next year.</p>
<p>Also on the roadmap is <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.maluuba.com/post/32225860762/how-would-you-use-an-accurate-natural-language">an API</a> that will allow developers to tap into Maluuba&#8217;s natural language processing capabilities. This API will likely launch within the next month.</p>
<p>Also coming soon is support for additional topic domains, including restaurant reservations, shopping and sports updates. These areas, of course, lend themselves nicely to revenue-sharing and affiliate partnerships.</p>
