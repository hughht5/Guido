<p>As more than a few pundits had predicted in the days leading up to the event, Apple has just officially pulled back the curtains on an updated version of its iBooks iOS app.</p>
<p>The new version of iBooks is available today, and always it won&#8217;t cost you a penny to download. That said, there&#8217;s little question that Apple is getting their money&#8217;s worth here &#8212; according to CEO Cook, there are over 1.5 million books available in the iBooks store, and over 400 million of those iBooks have been downloaded since the service&#8217;s launch.</p>
