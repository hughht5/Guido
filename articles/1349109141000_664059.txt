Firefox 18 is <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Releases#Firefox_18">scheduled</a> to arrive in Mozilla&#8217;s Aurora release channel in about a week. After that, it will make its way through the beta channel and finally become the stable version around the second week of January 2013.</p>
<p>Clearly, the Firefox team is taking its time with Retina support. Google&#8217;s Chrome, which set the trend for rapid-release schedules among browser developers, already introduced Retina support <a target="_blank" href="http://chrome.blogspot.com/2012/07/new-senses-for-web.html">at the end of July</a>, just about a month and a half after the feature made <a target="_blank" href="http://chrome.blogspot.com/2012/06/chrome-and-new-shiny.html">its first appearance</a> in the Google Chrome Canary channel (Google&#8217;s equivalent to Firefox&#8217;s nightly releases).</p>
<p>With Firefox 18, Mozilla also <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.mozilla.org/javascript/2012/09/12/ionmonkey-in-firefox-18/">plans to launch</a> IonMonkey, the latest version of its JavaScript engine, which is the result of a yearlong project to increase the browser&#8217;s JavaScript performance. Judging by the first benchmarks the organization <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/262289/new_javascript_tech_will_make_firefox_18_faster.html">released</a> last month, we can indeed expect Firefox to get a significant speed boost (around 25 percent in Google&#8217;s V8 benchmark, for example) from this project.</p>
<p>If you have a Retina MacBook and want to give this a try, the latest nightly builds are available for download here. This is obviously pre-release software and could go up in flames any time, but for the most part, these builds are actually more stable than the name implies.</p>
