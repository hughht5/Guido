<p>Co-founder and CEO Oliver Cameron says he isn&#8217;t abandoning the Everyme product. In fact, the company <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.everyme.mobile.android&amp;hl=en">just launched a version for Android tablets</a>. But with six people, trying to work on both apps at once would be a strain, so the team will be focusing on Origami for the next few months before turning its attention back to Everyme. (Cameron&#8217;s also hoping to hire more people. After all, Everyme just <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/31/everyme-tencent/">raised funding from Tencent and others</a>.)</p>
<p>&#8220;We love Everyme,&#8221; Cameron says. &#8220;I can see us running both services for a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a while? Well, he says that the company might have to drop Everyme if Origami &#8220;super takes off.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for why he&#8217;s building Origami in the first place, Cameron says the response to Everyme suggested that there was real interest in private sharing among families, but he thinks the use case &#8220;deserves its own product.&#8221; Origami isn&#8217;t launching today, just looking for testers, so Cameron is a bit cagey about the product details. He will say that the team has found a solution to one of the big challenges — convincing non tech-savvy users to sign up.</p>
<p>Cameron adds that many of the existing family-focused websites like Ancestry.com are &#8220;terrible, terrible products,&#8221; which creates a big opportunity. Oh, and Origami will be a paid product. Here&#8217;s how it&#8217;s described on the website:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are building Origami.com to make it so easy and delightful to stay in touch consistently that you will actually do it. Origami is a permanent home for you and those closest to you. It’s a place to see and hear the people who love you. It’s a place to chat, archive memories, and plan get-togethers. It’s a place to spread the word and keep everyone in the loop. Origami is not just another site to build a family tree; it’s a living monument to your family for generations.</p></blockquote>
