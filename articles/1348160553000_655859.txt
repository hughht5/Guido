<p>Co-founder and CEO Oliver Cameron says the startup isn&#8217;t abandoning the Everyme product. In fact, it <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.everyme.mobile.android&amp;hl=en">just launched a version for Android tablets</a>. However, Cameron says the team will be focusing on Origami for the next few months before turning its attention back to Everyme — with just six people, trying to work on both apps concurrently would be a strain. (He&#8217;s also hoping to hire more people. After all, Everyme just <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/31/everyme-tencent/">raised funding from Tencent and others</a>.) He adds that if Origami turns into an enormous hit, then it might not make sense to continue supporting Everyme.</p>
<p>So why build a family-specific product? The response to Everyme suggested that there was real interest in private sharing from families, Cameron says, but he felt that use case &#8220;deserves it&#8217;s own product.&#8221; Origami isn&#8217;t launching today, just looking for testers, so Cameron is a bit cagey about the product details, but he suggests that he&#8217;s found a solution to one of the big challenges facing a product like this — convincing non tech-savvy users to sign up.</p>
<p>Cameron also says that many of the existing family-focused services are &#8220;terrible, terrible products.&#8221;</p>
