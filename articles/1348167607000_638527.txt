<p>&#8220;In the Studio&#8221; continues after last week&#8217;s Disrupt conference by hosting a guest who, after various stints in finance, venture capital, and at one of the Valley&#8217;s storied Internet companies, joined a small but scrappy early-stage venture firm that, in the past few years, has grown into its successes and pioneered new approaches to investing in young technology companies.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/kentgoldman">Kent Goldman</a>, now a Partner at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.firstround.com/team/profile/kent_goldman/">First Round Capital</a>, works alongside six investment professionals and six colleagues who work on the firm&#8217;s platform initiatives, all spread out between their offices in New York City, San Francisco, and Philadelphia. For an early-stage fund with $135M under management and a portfolio of well over 100 companies, Goldman and his partners needed to find a way to scale their approach. Their solution &#8212; to create a platform &#8212; turned out to be quite forward-thinking.</p>
<p>In this video, Goldman discusses the steps First Round took to conceive of and build the firm&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://redeye.firstround.com/2012/02/brett-berson-turning-a-portfolio-into-a-community.html">platform</a>, based largely on the belief that one of the highest-value items they, as investors, could add was to facilitate discussions between founders they&#8217;d backed, both online and offline. Building a platform is the type of move investors are making to reinvent venture capital services in an industry that is being <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/28/the-seven-forces-disrupting-venture-capital/">challenged</a> by a number of unrelated forces. This would be an important discussion for early founders and investors considering their choices and/or changes to their model, as First Round&#8217;s choices over the past few years have helped position the firm as one of the leaders in early-stage investing.</p>
