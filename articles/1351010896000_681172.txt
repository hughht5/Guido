Following the combination of the two companies&#8217; content, omg! will be rebranded as omg! Insider, Yahoo says.</p>
<p>In case you&#8217;re not familiar with <a target="_blank" href="http://omg.yahoo.com/">omg!</a>, the website is an online portal which serves up tabloid-esque entertainment news, celebrity interviews, photo galleries and more. It&#8217;s a lot of fluff, really, but fluff is popular on the Internet. With the CBS deal, the omg! site will transition to become the official home for video highlights from a new omg! Insider show, which will be hosted by current The Insider staffers, Kevin Frazier and Brooke Anderson. They will also be joined by Yahoo&#8217;s Kristen Aldridge (<a target="_blank" href="http://ycorpblog.com/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-feed-statistics/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL3NjcmVlbi55YWhvby5jb20vd29tZW4vb21nLW5vdy8=">omg! NOW</a>) and Michael Yo (<a target="_blank" href="http://ycorpblog.com/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-feed-statistics/feed-statistics.php?url=aHR0cDovL3NjcmVlbi55YWhvby5jb20veW8tc2hvdy8=">The Yo Show on Yahoo!</a>).</p>
<p>The site, which will relaunch in early 2013, will feature in-studio celebrity interviews, and other conversations around the day&#8217;s hottest celeb news and trends. Yahoo describes the show as a &#8220;true web and on-air collaboration&#8221; between the two companies, which &#8220;aims to reinvent how consumers access entertainment news across screens.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a statement posted to <a target="_blank" href="http://ycorpblog.com/2012/10/23/omg-insider-cbs-tv/">Yahoo&#8217;s company blog</a> this morning, CEO Marissa Mayer talked about how the deal helps expand Yahoo&#8217;s goal of hosting more original programming. &#8221;We’re thrilled to bring together two of today’s most popular entertainment news brands to create an ‘always-on’ content experience across TV, the Web and beyond,” Mayer said. “Yahoo! is focused on bringing the most personalized and relevant information to our users. Original video content and branded multi-screen programming help us to deliver on that promise. We’re proud to collaborate with CBS Television Distribution to bring omg! Insider to millions of viewers in such a unique and exciting way.&#8221;</p>
