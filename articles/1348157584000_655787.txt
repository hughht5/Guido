The main feature here is Opera&#8217;s so-called &#8220;Smart Page,&#8221; which is meant to give you a quick and easy-to-read update of what&#8217;s happening in your social network, as well as a list of personalized news updates and a section with suggested links based on your location. The Smart Page, says Opera, is supposed to give you &#8220;a birds-eye view of what&#8217;s happening.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/20/opera-mini-smart-page/mini75-ill/" rel="attachment wp-att-655796"></a>The social tab allows you to see updates from your friends on Facebook, Twitter, and vKontakte, the European social network that is especially popular among Russian-speaking users. The news section, says Opera, will learn from your browsing habits and show you headlines relevant to you, while the list of suggested links will feature &#8220;relevant links based on the region your Android phone is located.&#8221; These suggested links will come from Opera and the company&#8217;s partners (though it&#8217;s not clear if companies pay for inclusion in this list).</p>
<p>Opera Mini also continues to feature Opera&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.opera.com/browser/turbo/">Turbo Mode</a>, which compresses the sites you are looking at on Opera&#8217;s servers, saving you time and money (if you are on a metered or pay-per-megabyte plan) as Opera Mini can reduce the amount of data transferred by up to 90 percent.</p>
<p>On Android, the company also offers <a target="_blank" href="http://www.operamini.com/mobile/">Opera Mobile</a>, which is a more full-featured browser for more powerful phones. Opera Mobile does not feature this new Smart Page yet, but chances are it will also add it to this browser as well in the future.</p>
