It&#8217;s launching <a target="_blank" href="http://www.clucks.tv/">Clucks</a> &#8212; a quirkily-named social mobile word-guessing game that (perhaps cynically) hits all the right trends. It uses mobile video via the Viddy network; it&#8217;s based on turn-based gameplay a la Song Pop and Draw Something; it offers social graph integration with Facebook; <em>and</em> voice recognition, using APIs from Nuance, the voice company&#8217;s first foray into mobile gaming. But you know what? I think AOL may just be on to something.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been playing an alpha version of the game a bit for the last day, and I have to admit, it&#8217;s quite fun, and even a little addictive. </p>
<p>You are given a word that you need to describe to your opponent &#8212; say &#8220;roses.&#8221; You&#8217;re given a timer to limit how much time you have to explain your word. And you&#8217;re given a limit of words that you cannot use (eg flowers, love, red). Then, using your iPhone, you record yourself describing the word, with that video then getting checked by Siri for word violations. Then that video gets sent to your partner to guess it and type it into a space. Then the partner repeats th same process back to you with a new word. You can also play against the &#8220;Barnyard&#8221; of pre-recorded words if you don&#8217;t have an opponent.</p>
<p>The free app is AOL&#8217;s first mobile game, and it comes on the heels of several other mobile content forays. </p>
<p>These include its <a target="_blank" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/editions-by-aol/id447687307?mt=8">Editions</a> iPad news magazine; its Play music app (<a target="_blank" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/play-by-aol-music/id447805948?mt=8">iPhone</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aol.mobile.playMusic&amp;hl=en">Android</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/AOL-Inc-PLAY-Aol-Music/dp/B008L1T560">Kindle Fire</a>); and most recently an entertainment news app for Windows Phones called <a target="_blank" href="http://entrancebyaol.com/">Entrance</a>.</p>
<p>But this, says AOL&#8217;s Mobile First senior director Sol Lipman, is just the beginning for AOL: &#8220;We have some other ideas in the queue,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We built this as a platform, not a one-off game. The first game off that platform will be Clucks.&#8221; That should also safeguard AOL from some of the downside of working in social games &#8212; that often these things have a fast rise, and an equally fast drop (something that has stung Zynga since its purchase of Draw Something creators OMGPOP).</p>
<p>Clucks is free to play, and the intention is to make it advertising-supported rather than by virtual currency. That also links Clucks in more tightly with AOL&#8217;s wider business model, and gives it one more format to sell through to advertisers. (That also fits well with CEO Tim Armstrong&#8217;s intention to continue pushing forward on digital advertising innovation.) </p>
<p>The first sponsor for the game, AOL says, will be Sony Entertainment, which will be promoting a film through the game by getting actors from the film to pre-record word tests for the games &#8220;Barnyard&#8221; section. At the time of launch, AOL had not yet revealed which film or actor would be coming online first.</p>
