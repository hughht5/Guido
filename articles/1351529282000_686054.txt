But today the company has added a few more hot names to that list, including the today-announced <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/29/lg-nexus-4-android-smartphone/">LG Nexus 4</a>, the Nexus 7 with 3G, and the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/19/hands-on-with-the-htc-windows-phone-8x-yet-another-flagship-windows-phone-8-device/">HTC Windows Phone 8X</a>. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/29/lg-nexus-4-android-smartphone/">Nexus 4</a> was just announced by Google after a cancelled NYC event, but that doesn&#8217;t mean the smartphone has any less swag. The phone features a 4.7-inch 1280&#215;768 display, an 8-megapixel rear-facing camera, and of course pure vanilla Android 4.2 Jelly Bean. </p>
<p>Under the hood you&#8217;ll find a 1.5GHz Snapdragon S4 processor, 8GB or 16GB of internal storage, and 2GB of RAM. </p>
<p>The Windows Phone 8X, on the other hand, is Microsoft&#8217;s HTC flagship. It runs the Windows Phone 8 operating system in all its glory, with a 4.3-inch HD super LCD 2 display, a dual-core processor, and high-spec&#8217;d cameras to boot. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/19/hands-on-with-the-htc-windows-phone-8x-yet-another-flagship-windows-phone-8-device/">HTC Windows Phone 8X</a> will be available for $149.99 on-contract after a $50 mail-in rebate starting on November 14, whereas the Nexus 4 is available now via Google Play and will be available in T-Mobile stores on November 14. It&#8217;ll cost $199 with a two-year agreement.  </p>
<p>The Nexus 7 32GB will be available with T-Mobile service on November 5 for $299 via the Google Play store. </p>
