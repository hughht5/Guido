But for those who need no physical introduction to make purchasing decisions, pre-orders begin tomorrow. The phone will cost $199.99 on-contract. </p>
<p>We were originally unsure of the Optimus G would make it state-side but both <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/03/lgs-flagship-optimus-g-slated-to-hit-att-and-sprint-shelves-later-this-year/">Sprint and AT&amp;T recently announced</a> that they&#8217;d carry the device.  </p>
<p>The Optimus G is a powerhouse in the specs department, with a 4.7-inch HD IPS display, a 1.5 GHz quad-core Snapdragon S$ pro processor, 2GB of RAM a 13-megapixel camera, Android 4.0.4, and 4G LTE connectivity. The camera, in particular, is said to be quite the doozy, with zero shutter lag, the ability to take pictures while capturing video, and a feature that helps capture the best frame even if the shutter button wasn&#8217;t pressed at the exact right time. </p>
<p>In our <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/19/lgs-quad-core-flagship-optimus-g-to-make-u-s-debut-in-q4-we-go-hands-on/">hands-on</a> we found it was slim and very noticeably made of plastic, but that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve come to expect out of LG. The real question is how well it performs, which we&#8217;ll investigate in a formal review.<br />
<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/09/sprints-lg-optimus-g-has-a-better-camera-than-atts-heres-how-it-performs-hands-on/">Sprint has yet to announce</a> availability for the LG handset, but that should happen any minute considering the yellow carrier promised we&#8217;d see it &#8220;this fall&#8221;. </p>
