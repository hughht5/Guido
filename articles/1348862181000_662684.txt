It happens all of the time, right? Which app or service do you go to first to find a restaurant and get a table? For many, it might be Google Maps, then a phone call. Forget that, because foursquare is getting super robust as of late.</p>
<p>Luckily, making reservations just got really easy, thanks to a new partnership. Here&#8217;s what foursquare <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.foursquare.com/2012/09/28/foursquare-and-opentable-just-made-it-even-easier-to-plan-your-perfect-night-out/">had to say about its mashup with OpenTable today</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now when you’re searching for the perfect dinner spot with Explore on iPhone or Android, you’re just a few taps away from making a reservation. Foursquare’s teamed up with <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/05/youve-been-served-opentable-reaches-15-million-review-milestone/">OpenTable</a> to provide painless in-app reservation making at thousands of restaurants across the U.S., no phone calls necessary.</p></blockquote>

<p>When you find a venue under &#8220;Explore&#8221; that has an OpenTable integration, you&#8217;ll be prompted to go ahead and make the reservation. Super simple:</p>

<p>As I&#8217;ve said before, I&#8217;m using foursquare way more than I use a service like Yelp to find new places as I explore new cities. Explore is even handy in San Francisco, where there are hundreds of restaurants that I haven&#8217;t even discovered yet. Bringing all of this functionality into one place is a brilliant move by foursquare, and makes other services obsolete. </p>
<p>Was Dennis Crowley, foursquare CEO, testing this out today?</p>

<p>Either way, that much money for a salad is a crime.</p>
