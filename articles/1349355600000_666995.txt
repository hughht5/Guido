<p>ZocDoc says that Check-In will be free for patients and come at no additional cost to medical providers who are existing users of ZocDoc. The Check-In feature also saves patient information so that forms can be pre-filled before appointments. According to ZocDoc, this has been the top requested feature from current ZocDoc users.</p>
<p>The roll-out of Check-In will be gradual &#8212; starting today, 10 percent of ZocDoc patients will be able to use the feature, and it will be rolled out to all users over the coming weeks.</p>
<p>On the whole, ZocDoc&#8217;s growth has been going strong since it <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2007/09/18/techcrunch40-session-6-revenue-models-analytics/">launched way back in 2007</a>. The company currently works with healthcare providers in 31 metro areas in the United States, and is available in a total of 1400 cities, purportedly covering more than 1/3 of the US population.</p>
<p>ZocDoc has raised some serious venture capital funding from big-name backers &#8212; a total of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/zocdoc">$95 million to date</a> from the likes of Goldman Sachs, Khosla Ventures and DST Global, to name just a few. Healthcare is an increasingly attractive space for tech founders, but it&#8217;s also a very difficult one to get a real foothold in; so it&#8217;s good to see ZocDoc iterating on products that could have broad consumer usefulness and appeal such as Check-In.</p>
