That&#8217;s a correct statement, but the timing is very odd.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s why:</p>
<p>After looking at <a target="_blank" href="https://dev.twitter.com/terms/api-terms/diff">this handy page</a>, which shows the changes that happened with the latest Twitter API update and Terms of Service, version 1.1, I found that the &#8220;cloud hosting&#8221; reason that IFTTT points to in its email is unchanged.  That means that the company has been in violation of Twitter&#8217;s API for quite a few months.</p>
<p>Have a look:</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/20/ifttt-has-actually-been-in-violation-of-twitters-api-for-months-todays-move-unrelated-to-1-1/api-terms-of-service_-most-recent-changes-twitter-developers/" rel="attachment wp-att-656381"></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what it says:</p>
<blockquote><p>You may export or extract non-programmatic, GUI-driven Twitter Content as a PDF or spreadsheet by using &#8220;save as&#8221; or similar functionality. Exporting Twitter Content to a datastore as a service or other cloud based service, however, is not permitted.</p></blockquote>
<p>I can&#8217;t find out whether Twitter had reached out to IFTTT in the past about this, since I cannot get a statement from either company, but let&#8217;s get one thing straight, this move has nothing to do with Twitter&#8217;s new API changes, which I have felt strongly about, when it comes to constraining its usage.</p>
<p>In this case, it seems like IFTTT didn&#8217;t want to change its ways to play by the rules, but I&#8217;d like to hear it directly from them.</p>
<p>Facts are facts, and these are the facts.</p>
