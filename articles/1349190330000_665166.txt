<p>Jolla&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://jollatides.com/2012/10/02/jolla-official-press-release-october-2nd-2012/">release</a> does not detail exactly who is involved in the alliance &#8212; beyond citing &#8220;leading players in the industry&#8221; &#8212; but we&#8217;ve asked for more details and will update if we hear back. The company also says it anticipates membership of the alliance growing &#8212; name-checking as possible partners &#8220;chipset vendors, OEM and ODM manufacturers, operators and retailers&#8221;.</p>
<p>The alliance will be contributing €200 million ($259 million) to expedite growth of the Sailfish ecosystem, according to Jolla &#8212; although it notes that this investment will come in gradually, rather than as immediate financial backing.</p>
<blockquote><p>The alliance partners will be investing an estimated 200 million euros to ensure the success and rapid expansion of the new ecosystem. The 200M€ ecosystem financing will come in gradually from Jolla and as members join the alliance, which will include chipset vendors, OEM and ODM manufacturers, operators and retailers.</p></blockquote>
<p>The alliance is being established in Hong Kong &#8212; which continues the nascent mobile-maker&#8217;s focus on China. Jolla hasn&#8217;t released any smartphones yet &#8212; or indeed other MeeGo-based devices &#8212; but back in July it <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/16/meegos-saviour-heads-to-china-jolla-signs-deal-with-chinese-retailer-d-phone/">signed a sales and distribution deal with Chinese mobile phone retailer D.Phone</a>. It it is also establishing R&amp;D operations in Hong Kong and elsewhere in China.</p>
<p>&#8220;China is a game changer in the technology industry,&#8221; said Jussi Hurmola, CEO of Jolla, in a statement. &#8220;The next big mobile change will come from China and Jolla wants to be enabling it. There are massive resources and competence to transport the whole industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jolla has chosen Cyberport Hong Kong to host the Sailfish alliance data centre &#8212; noting</p>
<blockquote><p>The data centre is being established to host Sailfish’s infrastructure, data, productisation facilities and collaboration services. In addition, some of the upcoming ecosystem&#8217;s cloud services will be provided from there. The OS and UX are highly scalable and will support smartphones, tablets, televisions, automotive and other device classes.</p></blockquote>
<p>MeeGo was formed back in 2010 by Nokia in partnership with Intel (merging their respective Maemo and Moblin Linux-based OS efforts) &#8212; but subsequently jettisoned by Nokia when it decided to focus on Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Phone OS as its primary smartphone platform.</p>
