Back in February European accelerator <a target="_blank" href="http://HackFwd.com">HackFwd</a> invested in the startup from Riga, Latvia, and now it&#8217;s fully launched its service. It&#8217;s competing in the space with <a target="_blank" href="http://piktochart.com/">Piktochart</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.easel.ly/">Easel.ly</a>. And not to mention one or two infographic designers out there&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s launched with 20 new data visualization formats from the simple like pie charts and graphs to the complex like multi-layer data-grids.</p>
<p>The web-based Infogr.am needs no programming or design skills, and works in the same way that you can snap a photo and share it on your social networks. Users make a statement or an argument graphically and then share it.</p>
<p>With a built-in spreadsheet engine and simple drag-and-drop interface, an infographic can be created and embedded on a page or shared as a link or an image directly. Uldis Leiterts, Founder, says the sites supports data import from XLS and CSV.</p>
<p>Is this going to put info graphics designers out of business? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.</p>
