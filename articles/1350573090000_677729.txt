<p>The Droid Razr HD and Droid Razr Maxx HD have pranced their way <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/05/motorola-officially-unveils-the-droid-razr-hd-and-droid-razr-maxx-hd/">across a stage or two</a>, and they&#8217;re even the stars of a new commercial, but today you&#8217;ll get to go face-to-face with the hot new Googorola phones at a Verizon store for $199 and $299 respectively.</p>
<p>This also marks the beginning of a new price cycle for the carriers, which seems to be starting at Amazon Wireless, where the $199 Galaxy S III has been dropped to $99 on <a target="_blank" href="http://wireless.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-III-Android-Wireless/dp/B008HTJLF6">Verizon</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://wireless.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-III-Android-Sprint/dp/B0097MVKW4">Sprint</a>.</p>
<p>Sprint, as you may recall, will be getting the Samsung Galaxy Note II <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/16/samsung-galaxy-note-ii-to-hit-sprint-on-october-25-with-a-299-price-tag/">on October 25 for $299</a>.</p>
<p>The Droid Razr HD and Razr Maxx HD mark the continuation of a profitable alliance in Verizon and Motorola, and solidify it with Google as a new backbone for Motorola after the $12.5 billion acquisition. But it&#8217;s also worth remembering that these phones ship with Android 4.0.4 ICS. <em>Not</em> Jelly Bean.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, these are top-of-the-line phones, with 4.7-inch Super AMOLED HD 720p displays, 1.5GHz dual-core Snapdragon processors, and an 8-megapixel shooter that captures 1080p video. Not to mention a super thin Kevlar fiber casing.</p>
<p>And to top that off, Motorola promises great battery life, which is a struggle for all of us. The Droid Razr HD and Maxx HD have 2530 mAH and 3300 mAH batteries respectively, promising something like 16 and 21 hours of straight usage.</p>
<p>Both super phones are <a target="_blank" href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/store/controller?item=phoneFirst&amp;action=viewPhoneDetail&amp;selectedPhoneId=5985">available now</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/store/controller?item=phoneFirst&amp;action=viewPhoneDetail&amp;selectedPhoneId=5993">at Verizon</a>.</p>
