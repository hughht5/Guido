That&#8217;s right: we&#8217;re bringing the magic of our <a href="http://techcrunch.com/tag/southeast-meetup/">Southeast Meetups</a> to Hogtown, Motor City, and the City in a Garden and we&#8217;d love to see you there.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s going down: we&#8217;re in planning stages right now so we&#8217;d love some help figuring out the best spot for holding the event and lining up sponsors. Toronto looks to be pretty much settled thanks to our buddy <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jpuopolo.com">Joseph Poupolo</a> of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.printchomp.com/home/index">Printchomp</a> but we can still use sponsors for each event.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll open RSVPs once we figure out a location. If you&#8217;d like to suggest a spot, drop me a line at john @ techcrunch.com with the subject line DETROIT, TORONTO, or CHICAGO. If you&#8217;d like to sponsor one or all of these fantastic gatherings, or know someone that should, shoot a message to our amazing sponsorship team <a target="_blank" href="mailto:sponsors@techcrunch.com">here</a>. That way we can keep things organized.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re planning on driving from Toronto down to Chicago so it should be quite a hoot. If the Southeast meetups were any indication, these will be outright amazing and we&#8217;re really looking forward to seeing you guys. Watch this space for more information and get ready &#8211; this is going to be fun.</p>
