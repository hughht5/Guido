Yesterday, Yahoo&#8217;s new CEO <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/marissa-mayer">Marissa Mayer</a> shared her broad vision for the future of the Internet company with employees.  </p>
<p>According to <a target="_blank" href="http://allthingsd.com/20120925/mayer-to-yahoos-at-not-so-radical-confab-personalization-mobile-rule-of-100-million-and-most-of-all-the-four-cs/">AllThingsD</a>, Mayer didn&#8217;t share specific plans for fixing search and email or an &#8220;in-process and dramatic home page redesign.&#8221; While ATD reporter Kara Swisher seems to have the phones at Yahoo bugged, and perhaps a @yahoo-inc.com email address, she hasn&#8217;t been able to get a peak at the redesign.  Yahoo has also been cracking down on leaks, but that didn&#8217;t stop us.</p>

<p>Yes, the new home page looks a lot like the home page of Google,  Mayer&#8217;s former employer.  In fact Mayer, who was Google employee number 20, oversaw the famous clean, plain white search home page at Google.  We&#8217;ve also heard that she was responsible for the longest time with no changes on that home page. So the new Yahoo home page mockup is not that surprising.</p>
<p>Mayer has been borrowing many ideas from her years at Google including a focus on product and data, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/17/marissa-mayers-30-days-in/">free food</a> in the cafeteria, and weekly &#8220;FYI&#8221; meetings like Google&#8217;s &#8220;TGIF&#8221; meetings.  She is also approving all company hires, just like the Google co-founders.</p>
<p>Mayer has already removed some ads from the home page <a target="_blank" href="http://allthingsd.com/20120923/what-will-marissa-do-mayer-set-to-reveal-her-strategy-to-troops-this-week-in-an-act-of-radical-transparency-internal-memo/">according to AllThingsD</a>. But this new ad-free home page design is a surprise and a risk since the Yahoo home page generates substantial ad revenue for the company.</p>
<p>The new home page features links for key areas that Yahoo plans to double-down on, including Search, Mobile, and Social.  It also has links to the <a target="_blank" href="http://allthingsd.com/20120925/mayer-to-yahoos-at-not-so-radical-confab-personalization-mobile-rule-of-100-million-and-most-of-all-the-four-cs/">reported</a> 4 C&#8217;s that are part of Mayer&#8217;s goals for talent at Yahoo: culture, company goals, calibration, and compensation.</p>
<p>If you are not logged in, Yahoo&#8217;s home page first top nav button is &#8220;You!&#8221;, similar to Google&#8217;s &#8220;+You.&#8221;</p>
<p>Note also that Yahoo is dropping the Â® symbol from their logo, which was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/18/yahooligans/">first reported</a> by TechCrunch earlier this month.  But, not the ! symbol.</p>
<p>Hopefully, Mayer also has a good sense of humor.  I&#8217;ve heard she has a good laugh.</p>
