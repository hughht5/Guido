Without a native Google Maps for iOS app, however, Google&#8217;s only way onto the iPhone is as a web app. For the most part, the mobile version of Google Maps can easily rival the old Apple Maps app, but the one missing feature is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/help/maps/streetview/learn/where-is-street-view.html">Street View</a>. According to AllThingsD&#8217;s Walt Mossberg, however, <a target="_blank" href="http://allthingsd.com/20121002/google-moves-ahead-in-fight-to-dominate-the-map-apps/">that&#8217;s changing tomorrow</a>.</p>
<p>Google apparently gave Mossberg an exclusive look (bad Google!)Â at Street View in the web app. According to Mossberg, &#8220;these links worked well, allowing me to see the locations and pan around with a finger.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fact that Google is bringing Street View to the web app hasn&#8217;t exactly been a secret. The New York Times&#8217; David Pogue, for example, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/27/technology/personaltech/apples-new-maps-app-is-upgraded-but-full-of-snags-review.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1&amp;_moc.semityn.www&amp;ref=technology">wrote</a> that Google would introduce this feature within &#8220;two weeks&#8221; when he reviewed Apple&#8217;s new mapping app on September 26.</p>
<p>Despite all of this, of course, the web app can&#8217;t compete with the full Google Maps experience on Android, where users can also get spoken turn-by-turn directions and easy access to indoor maps, among other things. As far as Google&#8217;s native Google Maps app for iOS goes, it&#8217;s still not clear what Google&#8217;s plans really are and how far along the company is in the development process. Given the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/23/heres-what-goes-into-making-google-maps-will-apple-be-able-to-recalculate/">amount of work</a> the company puts into getting its maps right, though, it&#8217;s hard to imagine that Google won&#8217;t release its own native app very soon.</p>
