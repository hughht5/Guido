The mixture of charm, astuteness, and fascination with the little things that these reporters exhibited has always been great fun and their work is a real tonic in this age of blowhards blowing hard at each other.</p>
<p>The team recently visited both the DNC and RNC and interviewed a number of politicians, celebrities, and delegates. The result is called Election 2012 and is available now. The best thing? The team went the route of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/11/jim-gaffigan-releases-his-own-all-new-special-cutting-out-the-media-middleman/">Jim Gaffigan</a> and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/10/sabo/">Louis CK</a> and released the video as a $5 download right from their sight.</p>
<p>Payable via Paypal and Amazon, $5 gets you 5 streams or SD/HD downloads. The video is available in 720p resolution. The creators ask that you don&#8217;t, you know, pirate a movie by folks who wear their hearts on their sleeves and are so charming and I wish more journalists followed their lead. So don&#8217;t pirate it. </p>
<div style="margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px;padding-left:15px;border-left:3px solid #ccc;font-style:italic;">Please keep in mind that How&#8217;s Your News? is a very small, low-budget operation.   No one involved does this for the money &#8211; in fact we usually lose money doing it.   You will likely be able to find torrent copies of this film elsewhere and if that&#8217;s the only way you&#8217;ll watch it, then we understand and hope you enjoy it, really!   But we hope you&#8217;ll consider paying 5 bucks for this and if you do we&#8217;ll be really grateful.  If we can make films like this without losing money, we will continue to do so.  It&#8217;s up to you!  Thank you.</div>
<p>Here&#8217;s hoping this is one of their most profitable films yet.</p>
