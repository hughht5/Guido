Google is clearly aware of this and today, the company is making <a target="_blank" href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2012/10/building-quality-tablet-apps.html">a new push</a> to get developers to ensure that their apps run well on tablets. To do this, Google just launched a <a target="_blank" href="http://developer.android.com/distribute/googleplay/quality/tablet.html">Tablet App Quality Checklist</a> that walks developers through the process of getting their apps tablet-ready.</p>
<p>In concert with this launch, Google also just <a target="_blank" href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2012/10/building-quality-tablet-apps.html">announced</a> that it plans to launch a series of tablet-focused app collections in the Google Play store ahead of the holiday season.</p>
<p>Until the launch of the Nexus 7, developers really didn&#8217;t have any real incentives to make their apps tablet-ready. The lackluster sales of the first generation of Android tablets just didn&#8217;t make this effort worthwhile. This, of course, now creates somewhat of a vicious cycle, as the small number of tablet-ready Android apps could keep potential tablet buyers away from Android, despite the fact that the Nexus 7 is a pretty stellar piece of hardware.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://developer.android.com/distribute/googleplay/quality/tablet.html">checklist</a>, says Google, will help developers &#8220;focus on key aspects of quality, feature set, and UI that can have a significant impact on the app&#8217;s success.&#8221; Before publishing an app to Google Play, the company says, &#8220;it&#8217;s important to make sure that the app meets the basic expectations of tablet users through compelling features and an intuitive, well-designed UI.&#8221;</p>
<p>To change developers&#8217; impressions of Android on the tablet, Google is highlighting a number of <a target="_blank" href="http://developer.android.com/distribute/googleplay/spotlight/tablets.html">tablet success stories</a> from companies like Mint.com, TinyCo and Instapaper. Instapaper, for example, which worked with mobile development shop <a target="_blank" href="http://mobelux.com/">Mobelux</a> to launch <a target="_blank" href="http://instapaper.mobelux.com/">its tablet app</a>, says that it saw a 600% jump in downloads of its app the day pre-orders of the Nexus 7 began arriving. TinyCo, which brought its casual game <a target="_blank" href="http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tinyco.village">Tiny Village to Android tablets</a>, says that it saw a 35% increase in average revenue per paying users on tablets compared to users on Android phones.</p>
