The company&#8217;s customers &#8212; notably mobile carriers and telcos but also device makers, service providers, portals and system integrators &#8212; are already deploying its <a target="_blank" href="https://onemediahub.com/c/portal/layout?p_l_id=default">OneMediaHub</a> personal cloud repository to millions of their users. Funambol is aiming to use this latest cash injection, along with a working capital line, to further accelerate its rate of global growth.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;" align="center"><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2008/06/16/funambol-raises-125-million-series-b-aol-signs-up-as-customer/">Previous investors</a> in the company Nexit Ventures, Castile Ventures and HIG Growth Capital all participated in this round.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;" align="center">Funambol is explicitly taking aim at what it describes as &#8216;siloed&#8217; cloud services &#8212; i.e. proprietary services which require users to be locked into other platform-specific hardware or software services to access them. It specifically name-checks Apple&#8217;s iCloud, Google&#8217;s Drive and Microsoft&#8217;s SkyDrive services. By contrast, Funambol stresses its cloud offerings support multiple brands &#8212; thereby allowing users to avoid having to manage multiple cloud services. Device compatibility and flexibility are a given, thanks to Funambol&#8217;s open source roots.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;" align="center">The growth in consumer adoption of cloud services &#8212; from email and storage to calendar and contacts syncing &#8212; is driving demand for cross-device flexibility, the company reckons. And it&#8217;s this demand it&#8217;s seeking to capitalise on to fuel its own growth &#8212; as the companies buying its services look for ways to attract and retain their own customers.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;" align="center">&#8220;Major global mobile providers are seeking a white-label personal cloud solution, and we are delighted to work with them to grow their customer acquisition and retention capabilities,&#8221; noted Amit Chawla, Funambol CEO, in a statement. &#8220;Our new financing is validation of this surging market demand. It will enable us to accelerate our role as the leader of white-label personal cloud solutions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As we look at new investment opportunities, we are pleased that Funambol has signed major customers in a very short time span. Along with Nexit Ventures and Castile Ventures, we are increasing our investment in the company,&#8221; added Fred Sturgis, Managing Director, HIG Growth Capital, in a statement. &#8220;Mobile and personal clouds are one of the fastest growing segments in the industry.&#8221;</p>
