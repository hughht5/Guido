<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/fallout-2.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="fallout-2" title="fallout-2" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>GOG (formerly known as Good Old Games) is having a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gog.com/interplay">huge Interplay sale</a> that gives you 32 games for $34.99 (or more), or anywhere between $13.95 and $34.99 for 20 titles, or 8 games for whatever you want to pay under that. This is an amazing deal that will get you some classic titles you may well have grown up with. And that could make you feel old, but maybe good also: Nostalgia.</p>
<p>The retail price of $34.99 (again, you can pay more if you want) gets you the 32 DRM-free games, including Fallout, Fallout 2, Freespace, Freespace 2, a whole bunch of Descents, Earthworm Jims, MDKs and even Shattered Steel, the first game from the studio that would later bring us unforgettable RPGs like Mass Effect. If you&#8217;re not of the vintage to have played these when they were new releases, than consider this a $35 education in good video game design. Plus you&#8217;ll find out where Fallout 3 came from.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, these games retail for $191.68 altogether according to GOG, and you get 21 soundtracks for the games, as well as extras like the Fallout Bible, 410 pieces of game art, 38 manuals, avatars, maps, wallpapers and a whole bunch of other stuff besides. If you&#8217;re irresponsibly wealthy and feel like all of this is worth much more, you can pay up to $2,500 for the same exact deal you&#8217;d get at $35. GOG has run another pay-what-you-want sale, with GOG offering a similar scheme for the Divinity series of games earlier this month. Note that these games are Windows only, but system requirements are mercifully low, so you&#8217;ll probably have a decent experience running these in a virtual machine if you&#8217;re a Mac user.</p>
<p>Go buy this, it&#8217;s crazy not to, but you have a little over 12 days to decide before the sale runs out. I&#8217;ll leave you with the intro movie from Fallout 2 in case you need any more convincing, which blew my mind when the game first came out back in 1998.</p>
