<p>Welcome to the future, where you can essentially make a movie with believable special effects right on your smartphone.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cinefy-special-fx-studio/id481953440?mt=8">Cinefy</a>, an app that just launched on the App Store, makes this possible.</p>
<p>You can choose from literally hundreds of CGI effects to lay over your video. You can also drop music over the video from your iTunes library.</p>
<p>That includes dinosaurs, alien attacks, explosions, and lightning strikes, just to name a few. Obviously, this isn&#8217;t for the professional video maker. But for the rest of us, this could be just the ticket to sharing a funny video, finishing a school project, or making the kids laugh.</p>
<p>Especially with Halloween around the corner, it&#8217;s a perfect time to shoot kids in their costumes and lay over a few fun effects to get that spooky feeling going.</p>
<p>Just like iMovie, Final Cut Pro, or any other media editing software, the app uses a simple timeline-based interface and should be pretty simple for anyone to figure out. However, a tutorial or help video of some sort, built straight into the app, would be nice.</p>
<p>Even still, the folks at Cinefy clearly worked to make the controls mobile and touch-friendly. For example, if you want to shorten a song you threw in to the video (most effects are between 7 and 11 seconds) down to the size of the effect clip, the cursor speeds up once you begin dragging.</p>
<p>The app is a massive download, at 963MB, so be prepared for it. It costs $.99 and is available in the <a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cinefy-special-fx-studio/id481953440?mt=8">App Store</a> now.</p>
