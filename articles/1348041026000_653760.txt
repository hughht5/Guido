<p>Our boss <a target="_blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/jaykirsch">Jay Kirsch </a>often refers to TechCrunch as &#8220;Forbes during the sixties,&#8221; a description that royally annoys me because I think TechCrunch is just TechCrunch during the 2010s.</p>
<p>He also thinks that we actually have a job to do in convincing mainstream audiences to care about technology, or more specifically Consumer Internet technology, which also annoys me, because as far as I&#8217;m concerned Consumer tech culture<em> is</em> the new mainstream culture &#8212; i.e. more people are talking about <a target="_blank" href="http://www.techmeme.com/120918/p70#a120918p70">the iPhone 5</a> than the latest Rhianna album or whatever.</p>
<p>(We can talk Enterprise tech or whatever Founders Fund <a target="_blank" href="http://www.foundersfund.com/the-future">is doing</a> in another post.)</p>
<p>I mean, almost every day I&#8217;m party to the dumbest conversations about Instagram in the subway in NYC &#8212; Jay, the thing has around 30 million monthly active users, with 100 million registered users. That&#8217;s roughly a third of the population of the United States <a target="_blank" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=FFS">FFS</a>. Twitter&#8217;s got 140 million daily active users sending 340 million tweets per day. And one of them is <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/RyanSeacrest">Ryan Seacrest</a>!</p>
<p>So, when I wake up to see, for all intents and purposes, a &#8220;minor&#8221; Twitter product update <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/18/twitter-changes-are-now-all-about-advertisers-not-the-users/">featured on the Today Show</a>, I feel a little bit vindicated. First of all, we don&#8217;t need to &#8220;dumb down&#8221; our coverage to mainstream audiences: They care about product updates! If we build it they will come!</p>
<p>Second of all, while tech blogs are at least in philosophy a niche industry &#8212; the story of tech is a story of scale; startups that achieve mass scale &#8220;win,&#8221; to simplify things. Following this principle we, as in TechCrunch, would love to be featured on the Today Show &#8212; which gets <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/category/morning-show-ratings">roughly 5x </a>our visits on a good day. In fact, it should be our Q4 goal (Hi Jay!).</p>
<p>But, to transfer this scale principle to another industry that plays by similar rules, The Today Show is presently getting its ass kicked by Good Morning America, with 5.199 million to NBC&#8217;s 4.404 million viewers. GMA is also winning in the crucial &#8220;young viewer&#8221; demographic, which might be why the Today Show is targeting tech companies for their product launches; Twitter&#8217;s move isn&#8217;t unprecedented. Facebook unveiled its global launch of Facebook Timeline on the very same morning show.</p>
<p>While some called Twitter&#8217;s PR move <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/sarahcuda/status/248113487199490048">&#8220;bizarre&#8221;</a>, they somehow failed to see the scale logic behind it and why it&#8217;s an ultimate win for Silicon Valley. A win for tech literacy is a win for our entire community. Also, fellow tech blogs, if your middle class problem is that Twitter didn&#8217;t give YOU the exclusive (which would have been nice right?) then hustle harder and break the news before it&#8217;s spoonfed to you.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I wish we had done.</p>
