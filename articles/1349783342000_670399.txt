An end of October unveiling for the next generation of WP had been expected but today the date has been confirmed as October 29 &#8212; or at least that&#8217;s when a London press event will be held.</p>
<p>Microsoft has previously given strictly limited demos of WP8, keeping its powder dry ahead of the &#8216;big reveal&#8217;. It has also hinted there will be features tying the mobile OS into its desktop OS Windows 8 but not yet given specific details of how exactly that will work.</p>
<p>More to come&#8230;</p>
