An end of October unveiling for the next generation of WP had been expected but today the date has been confirmed as October 29 &#8212; or at least that&#8217;s when a London press event will be held.</p>
<p>Microsoft has previously given strictly limited demos of WP8, keeping its powder dry ahead of the &#8216;big reveal&#8217; (at one HTC press briefing for its new line-up of WP8 devices journalists were not allowed to navigate beyond the lock screen during their &#8216;hands on&#8217; time). Microsoft has also hinted there will be features tying the mobile OS into its desktop OS Windows 8 but not yet given specific details of how exactly that will work.</p>
<p>Last month <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/26/final-build-of-windows-phone-8-demoed/">a leaked SDK of WP8</a> popped up on WP Central &#8212; but didn&#8217;t appear to show any notable differences to features Microsoft has already demoed or which are included in its Windows Phone 7+ OS.</p>
<p>More to come&#8230;</p>
