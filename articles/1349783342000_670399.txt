An end of October unveiling for the next generation of WP had been expected but today the date has been confirmed as October 29 &#8212; or at least that&#8217;s when a London press event will be held.</p>
<p>Microsoft has previously given strictly limited demos of WP8, keeping its powder dry ahead of the &#8216;big reveal&#8217; (at one U.K. HTC press briefing for its new line-up of WP8 devices journalists were not allowed to navigate beyond the lock screen during their &#8216;hands on&#8217; time). Microsoft has also hinted there will be features tying the mobile OS into its desktop OS Windows 8 but not yet given specific details of how exactly that will work. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/09/invites-go-out-for-microsofts-windows-phone-8-event/image003-5/" rel="attachment wp-att-670436"></a></p>
<p>Back in July, during a demo of the new, more flexible WP8 (and WP7.8) homescreen, Microsoft&#8217;s WP senior product manager Greg Sullivan <a target="_blank" href="http://crave.cnet.co.uk/mobiles/windows-phone-7-was-doomed-by-design-microsoft-admits-50008466/">told me</a> to expect some &#8220;cool stuff&#8221; when the wraps finally come off Windows Phone 8. &#8221;There are a whole series of&#8230; new capabilities and features that will come that we haven&#8217;t talked about and there&#8217;s integration with Windows 8 that we&#8217;ll demo closer to the date,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>However last month <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/26/final-build-of-windows-phone-8-demoed/">a leaked SDK of WP8</a> popped up on WP Central &#8212; and didn&#8217;t appear to show any notable differences to features Microsoft has already demoed or which are included in its Windows Phone 7+ OS.</p>
<p>The invite itself doesn&#8217;t give much away &#8212; it&#8217;s just a save the date marker, so there&#8217;s no accompanying text to flesh out the invite. The graphic depicts a Windows Phone handset with a full battery icon, LTE connectivity, one missed call and a missed message icon displayed on it, along with the date and time of the London event.</p>
