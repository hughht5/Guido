To my surprise, I found that they were also selling <a target="_blank" href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php">Scrivener</a> &#8211; literally the best long-form writing app I&#8217;ve ever used &#8211; as well one year of Evernote Premium, a $60 value. In short, it&#8217;s some hot stuff.</p>

More important, 25% of your order goes to charity and even more important there&#8217;s only one day left so hop over there. However, if you&#8217;re serious about writing, you have to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2007/12/05/cg-holidays-2007-recommendation-scrivener/">get Scrivener</a>. It&#8217;s a distraction-free environment that is immensely powerful and has helped me write news articles to entire books. If only those guys would launch a freaking iPad app already then I could die a happy man.</p>
