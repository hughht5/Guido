In a post on the official Facebook blog, founder Mark Zuckerberg shared a note celebrating the milestone with a personal thank you to Facebook users.</p>
<p>Here it is in full:</p>
<blockquote><p>This morning, there are more than one billion people using Facebook actively each month.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re reading this: thank you for giving me and my little team the honor of serving you.</p>
<p>Helping a billion people connect is amazing, humbling and by far the thing I am most proud of in my life.</p>
<p>I am committed to working every day to make Facebook better for you, and hopefully together one day we will be able to connect the rest of the world too.</p></blockquote>
<p>Facebook has also shared a number of key metrics with users along with the announcement, including 1.13 trillion Likes since its 2009 launch (note that this is actually probably higher, since the official press document contains a note accidentally left in from an editor about rolling back the number because of info shared previously with Businessweek), 140.3 billion friend connections, 219 billion photos uploaded, 17 billion location-tagged posts and 62.6 million songs played some 22 billion times.</p>
<p>Median user age is around 22 for new users who joined in the week leading up to this milestone, and the top five countries supporting that growth in the same week were Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico and The US. Those numbers and that geographical breakdown are roughly the same as they were when Facebook hit 500 million monthly active users, and generally new users are younger than they were when Facebook crossed the 100 million mark.</p>
<p>This is a huge milestone for Facebook, and one that should likely have an effect on FB&#8217;s stock value when the markets open today. It&#8217;s also just a mind-boggling stat – that&#8217;s roughly 1/7 of the world&#8217;s population, logging on to the same social network and actively using it on a monthly basis. Crazy.</p>
