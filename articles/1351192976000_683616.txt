It was indeed quite simple, and now Flora has sent over the results.</p>
<p>The campaign actually used a tag embedded in the story itself, so readers of the post who then visited Facebook might see ads pointing them towards more of TechCrunch&#8217;s Facebook coverage. (There are other companies giving advertisers access to the Facebook Exchange for retargeting, but Perfect Audience is pitching itself as the one that&#8217;s the most accessible to small businesses.) The ads, which ran for about a week, saw 42,201 impressions, and resulted in 64 actual clicks, for a cost of $38.08 — though in this case, since it was just a test campaign, Perfect Audience footed the bill. That effectively works out to a CPM (cost per thousand impressions) of 90 cents and a cost-per-click of 60 cents.</p>
<p>To be clear, 64 returning readers aren&#8217;t exactly going to set TechCrunch&#8217;s traffic numbers on fire, but Flora pointed out that&#8217;s still &#8220;64 highly relevant people&#8221; who were brought back to the site with no real effort and a low cost.</p>
<p>In addition to my own little test, Flora updated me on Perfect Audience&#8217;s overall progress. The service is now being used by 600 small- and medium-sized businesses, as well as agencies and brands — in fact, Flora said he was surprised that there was so much interest outside the SMB world. He added that revenue is growing 25 percent per week, and 97 percent of free users are converting to the paid plan once the free trial runs out.</p>
<p>And in the weeks since Perfect Audience launched, it has also released a new feature — the ability to manage campaigns for multiple sites from a single account. Flora said this was a natural addition, since the team noticed that early customers were actually creating multiple accounts to manage multiple sites.</p>
