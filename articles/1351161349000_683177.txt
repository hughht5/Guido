<p>The investment means Datahug will now expand in the US and internationally. Current customers include Grant Thornton, Plantronics, BDO and CPL. DFJ Esprit is also a user of the software, as is Balderton Capital.</p>
<p>Datahug estimates that it finds around 400 contacts per person that aren’t captured in any CRM system or database. The solution works by indexing existing communication logs – such as emails, contacts and calendar data – to create an enterprise-wide picture of who knows who. Datahug then attributes a ‘HugRank’ score to show how well they know them. It requires no data entry to capture the relationships and connections that exist, making it easy-to-use and placing no demands on staff time or resources.</p>
