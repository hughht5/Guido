<p>The initial partners include Fitbit, Endomondo, runtastic, and Body Media â€” which all offer some sort of fitness tracking, either through your smartphone or a special device of their own. Previously, if users wanted to bring that exercise data into their MyFitnessPal diary, they had to manually enter it. Starting today, they can sync their accounts with API partners, so that MyFitnessPal is automatically updated with data from outside services.</p>
<p>This could be pretty powerful for MyFitnessPal, making it a ubiquitous health diary that works no matter which other devices or services you choose. Asked if it was a challenge to convince other companies to share their user data, co-founder Mike Lee said, &#8220;Not really. I think all of our partners saw that this really makes sense. And again, their users were also asking for this.&#8221;</p>
<p>For now, the API is private, so that MyFitnessPal can hand-select its partners. (The company is highlighting all of its current partners in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.myfitnesspal.com/apps">the app gallery here</a>.) At the same time, Lee said he&#8217;s definitely excited about seeing new use cases that he couldn&#8217;t have thought up on his own.</p>
<p>MyFitnessPal is also sharing some numbers about its growth today, specifically the fact that it now has 30 million registered users. Lee said the company has been relatively quiet about its success, at least in speaking with the press, but now the team feels ready to call attention to the fact that it has built a big user base.</p>
<p>That kind of scale gives the startup unique advantages, Lee added. It certainly made the API more compelling for its partners, and also allowed MyFitnessPal to enlist its community&#8217;s help in building up a food database with 2 million of items.</p>
