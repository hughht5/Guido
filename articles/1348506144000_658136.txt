Today it announced that it has bought <a target="_blank" href="http://www.savored.com">Savored</a>, a restaurant reservations and discount meal provider. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>
<p>Savored is used by some 1,000 restaurants and gives diners discounts of up to 40% when they book through the site. Much of Groupon&#8217;s existing restaurant business is based around paying for food up front, while this gives Groupon more scope to cover other functions like table bookings. Savored exists in the same category as <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/04/with-an-extra-1-2m-from-rally-capital-pirq-adds-loyalty-natl-rollout-to-its-restaurant-deals-app/">Pirq</a>, which also offers restaurant discounts to help facilitate &#8220;yield management&#8221; at restaurants &#8212; or the ability to better balance peaks and troughs in customer foodfall, and subsequent supply/productivity issues.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/18/groupon-on-a-buying-spree-buys-mobile-payment-specialist-kima-labs/">Unlike some other acquisitions</a> that Groupon has made, it will continue to keep Savored up and running.</p>
<p>The move also widens the scope of what Groupon is doing as a one-stop shop for retailers&#8217; e-commerce activities &#8212; something that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/07/beyond-the-daily-deal-groupon-has-170m-deals-33m-users-aims-to-be-the-os-for-local-commerce/">Andrew Mason laid out</a> as a priority back in May, when he said he wanted Groupon to &#8220;become the operating system for local commerce.&#8221;</p>
<p>To that end, it looks like Savored will be sitting in the Groupon Now! product team, reporting to VP Dan Roarty.</p>
<p>Savored used to be called VillageVines, and it <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/19/savored/">rebranded in June 2011</a>, when it also added Buddy Media&#8217;s Michael Lazerow as an investor and board member. Ironically, back then, it made a point of noting how it was <em>nothing</em> <em>like</em> Groupon. &#8220;We don’t have sky diving, we don’t have spas and salons,” said co-founder Daniel Leahy at the time.</p>
<p>Release below.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Groupon Completes Acquisition of Savored</strong></p>
<p>CHICAGO&#8211;(BUSINESS WIRE)&#8211; Groupon (http://www.groupon.com) (NASDAQ: GRPN) announced today it has acquired Savored (http://www.savored.com), a leading provider of reservations at the best restaurants across the United States. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 restaurants nationwide have used Savored&#8217;s unique platform for yield management. After booking a reservation on Savored.com and visiting the restaurant, diners enjoy up to a 40% discount applied automatically to their bill.
