New data from<a target="_blank" href="http://www.chartboost.com"> Chartboost</a> today, covering the time between iOS 6&#8242;s launch and Wednesday, suggests that user uptake of Apple&#8217;s latest mobile OS might be leveling off after an initial rush. It took just five days to reach over 30 percent adoption, and only eight for iOS 6 to become the dominant version, but now there&#8217;s been relatively little growth in the past week, with overall adoption staying at 45.3 percent both for both Tuesday and Wednesday of this week.</p>
<p>As with other data we&#8217;ve seen from different sources, Chartboost shows the iPhone out ahead in terms of iOS 6 adoption, with the iPad coming in second and the iPod touch as the laggard in terms of hardware being upgraded. But whereas we&#8217;ve seen claims of over <a title="iOS 6 Adoption At Just Over One Week: 60% For iPhone And 41% For iPad" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/28/ios-6-adoption-at-just-over-one-week-60-for-iphone-and-41-for-ipad/">60 percent adoption from Onswipe</a> and Chitika, Chartboost says that&#8217;s much lower. Chartboost&#8217;s sample pool covers millions of unique devices through its publisher&#8217;s apps every hour, however, so its sample size is significant.</p>
<p>A leveling off of iOS 6 installs could be a sign that news of Maps and other problems users aren&#8217;t crazy about are spreading, and outweighing the many benefits of upgrading. It could also just be that a drop-off in upgrade pace is natural, as early adopters are all now on board, and additional users will take their time and upgrade at a slower pace. Even without a continued high growth rate, the penetration iOS 6 has achieved to date is already very impressive, and a rarity among mobile software update patterns, regardless of platform.</p>
