Not so much is the case with Vice-President Joe Biden. His opponent, Republican candidate <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/12/vp-pick-paul-ryan-has-mostly-been-a-friend-to-technology/">Paul Ryan</a>, has 10 times as many Facebook fans (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/PaulRyanVP">4 million</a> vs. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/joebiden">400k</a>). Interestingly, Paul Ryan is so much more popular than Biden online, that when comparing the top Google keywords associated with each Vice-Presidential contender, Google Politics found that &#8220;Ryan&#8221; was the top reason why people were searching for Biden in the first place.</p>

<p>In part, this is because the often gaff-prone Biden has eschewed public limelight for building congressional relationships and working on Obama&#8217;s prized policies. &#8220;you cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin&#8217; Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent,&#8221; then-senator Biden once said. The lack of publicity has certainly underwhelmed the American public.</p>
<p>In other ways, Romney&#8217;s ace digital team has had an impressive social media track record, as even the social media blog, InsideFacebook <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/07/how-romneys-digital-director-zac-moffatt-got-silicon-valley-brightest-minds-to-work-for-the-campaign/">has admitted</a>. For one, they were early adopters of Facebook&#8217;s sponsored search feature, where Paul Ryan&#8217;s page comes up first when searching for Joe Biden&#8217;s.</p>
<p>(for those curious about the top keywords for Ryan, &#8220;Stench&#8221; refers to a <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2012/09/paul_ryan_calls.php">Gawker rumor</a> and AARP is likely <a target="_blank" href="http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-paul-ryan-booed-aarp-20120921,0,6615741.story">related</a> to him being booed one of their rallys)</p>
<p>It also helps that Ryan&#8217;s P90X dashingly good looks have the subject of many memes, including my favorite, @<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/PaulRyanGosling">paulryangosling</a></p>

<p>Normally, we argue social media, and especially follower counts <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/11/the-importance-of-social-media-in-elections-mostly-hot-air/">don&#8217;t matter</a> much for politicians, but real-time commenting <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/03/how-technology-destroyed-the-once-substantive-presidential-debate/">is known</a> to influence how viewers see televised debates, and the running peanut gallery of Ryan-heads online could skew people in his favor.</p>
