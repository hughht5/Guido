If you surfed the web in the late 90s you probably saw a lot of homepages with Hitbox&#8217;s graphics in their footers. Maybe you even had one on your Geocites page.</p>
<p>Hitbox was eventually M&amp;Aed out of existence, but WebSideStory co-founder Blaise Barrelet and few other alumni have spent the past few years working on <a target="_blank" href="http://anametrix.com/">Anametrix</a>, an analytics startup that just announced a $4.4 million series A led by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/tvc-capital">TVC Capital</a>.</p>
<p>Anametrix was founded in 2009 and <a target="_blank" href="http://anametrix.com/press-releases/2010-03-17/">in 2010</a> it acquired <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/nordic-research">Nordic Research Corporation</a>, an analytics company founded by former WebSideStory system architect Anders Olsson. Olsson is now CTO of Anametrix and is considered a co-founder. Other WebSideStory alum at Anametrix include chief marketing officer Pelin Thorogood and general counsel/VP of corporate development Michael Christian.</p>
<p>So why yet another analytics company? Anametrix&#8217;s play is to help unify disparate analytics services into a single platform. &#8220;We&#8217;re not here to replace other data sources like Omniture or Radian6,&#8221; Thorogood says. Instead, the company&#8217;s service can integrate with other other analytics systems of various types, including web analytics, social media analytics and data from e-mail and search engine marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>The idea is not just to give users a single pane of glass to look at their analytics, but to mashup all the data to find trends and relationships that might not otherwise be visible &#8212; and to give its customers insight into how well different marketing campaigns are performing. </p>
<p>Anametrix can integrate with many existing solutions out of the box. It also has an API and a connector for the R programming language.</p>
<p>Thorogood explains that although Anametrix provides a software-as-a-service, up until now the company has had to do a large amount of customization for each customer. That&#8217;s why today it&#8217;s introducing Campaign Analytics, a self-service product running on top of the existing Anametrix platform that will help customers get up and running without having to rely on professional services.</p>
<p>Back in 2000 Barrelet <a target="_blank" href="http://technology.inc.com/2000/01/01/the-new-boy-network/">admitted to <em>Inc.</em> in 2000</a> that he &#8220;didn&#8217;t even know that there were venture-capital firms&#8221; when Hitbox launched in 1996. That&#8217;s obviously not a problem for Barrelet anymore. Previous to today&#8217;s round the company raised <a target="_blank" href="http://www.xconomy.com/san-diego/2010/09/09/san-diego-business-analytics-startup-anametrix-launched-by-websidestory-founder-blaise-barrelet-raises-1-15m/">raised $2.3 million</a> from early stage investors, including Analytics Ventures, Airtek Capital Group, WMAS Management Group and Alain Schreiber.</p>
