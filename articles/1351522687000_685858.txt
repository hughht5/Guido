This will reduce congestion on mobile networks, allowing for better communication for everyone in the path of Frankenstorm.</p>
<p>Hurricane Sandy is likely going to wreak hell on several states. There is expected to be widespread flooding and wind damage. Despite <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/29/verizon-sprint-t-mobile-hunker-down-for-hurricane-sandy-att-is-like-whatevs/">the best efforts by carriers</a> and utility companies, wireless networks will be affected. Don&#8217;t be selfish with your phone use.</p>
<p>The idea behind FEMA&#8217;s plan is sound. Voice calls consume significantly more bandwidth than text messages or data usage. It&#8217;s very important to communicate but your mom does not need a play-by-play of the action. Tune to The Weather Channel for that. Text messages and social networks are well-suited to handle the simple message of &#8220;My building survived. I&#8217;m fine. Going to the bar. #freetebow&#8221;</p>
