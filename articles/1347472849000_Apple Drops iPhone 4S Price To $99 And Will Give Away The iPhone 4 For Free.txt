<p>Apple is perpetuating the same strategy by keeping the previous generation iPhone in its line-up to attract customers concerned by the price. The iPhone 4 will stay in the lineup as well and Apple will give it away if you sign a two-year contract in the U.S. A similar offering should show up around the world.</p>
<p>With the iPhone 4S, the company is competing directly with entry-level smartphones, such as <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/07/the-razr-m-motorolas-clever-answer-to-the-99-iphone-4s/">the Motorola Razr M</a>.</p>
<p>Producing a cheaper phone is important as well for emerging markets, such as China, Brazil or Russia. It will allow users to switch from a feature phone to a smartphone. The platform and ecosystem lock-in is key to understanding that price point. After buying apps on the App Store and accessories specifically made for the iPhone, you will tend to keep buying iPhone products.</p>
<p>The question is whether users will buy a 3.5-inch 3G smartphone when nearly every smartphone now has a bigger screen and LTE connectivity.</p>
