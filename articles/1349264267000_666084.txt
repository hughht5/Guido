The <a target="_blank" href="http://st.revelsystems.com/collections/market-place-for-ipad-pos-community/">Revel Marketplace</a> provides a way for merchants and businesses to browse and easily install add-ons for their POS installations, including Facebook and Twitter integration; loyalty and rewards programs like Perkville; payment methods like Dwolla and LevelUp; daily deal services like Groupon and LivingSocial, and more.</p>
<p>This opens up a lot of possibilities for Revel merchants, to essentially build the custom POS they need. One example of an integration Revel CEO and co-founder Lisa Falzone shared with me in an interview is a sales tracker than can automatically push out ads to web-based advertising networks when it detects that sales are slowing, in real-time. So far, the marketplace offers just over a dozen integrations, but plenty more are in the works.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of different startups in Silicon Valley are interested in it, because they&#8217;re looking at our real-time sales data, our inventory tracking, and they&#8217;re finding ways to make restaurants [and other businesses] more efficient,&#8221; Falzone said. While there are way for companies to build similar tools for existing, legacy POS setups, the open, cloud-based nature of Revel and the API it provides makes creating apps that leverage its data much easier than with older, non-connected systems that aren&#8217;t necessarily designed for third-party integrations.</p>
<p>Revel&#8217;s marketplace offerings will provide merchants with both free and paid integrations, and the POS-maker itself will work out different revenue sharing arrangements with companies on a case-by-case basis. Revel will also review developer submissions, to ensure that there&#8217;s a consistent, high level of quality maintained across its third-party offerings.</p>
<p>Revel has been on a roll, raising a <a title="Revel Systems Debuts An iPad Point-Of-Sale In A Box" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/27/revel-systems-debuts-an-ipad-point-of-sale-in-a-box/">$3.7 million Series A in May of 2011</a> and apparently hitting their stride in terms of revenue generation on the back of that relatively small amount, impressive for a company whose product involves quite a few hardware components. There&#8217;s also its <a target="_blank" href="http://betakit.com/2012/04/05/revel-partners-with-levelup-and-geek-squad-to-add-to-ipad-pos">partnership with Best Buy&#8217;s Geek Squad</a>, which provides a service and installation arm for its customers, while avoiding the costs of maintaining that kind of force on staff at all times. Falzone said that&#8217;s what&#8217;s next for the company is a big hiring push, to grow the 30-person team, particularly by adding new experienced sales staff and additional engineers.</p>
