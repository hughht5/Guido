Even Rovio (the company responsible for the ultra-successful bird-flinging app) is a logo as familiar as EA&#8217;s. But today we&#8217;ll have to add another bit of vocabulary to our repertoire. Prepare yourselves: Bad Piggies has arrived.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve known about <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/04/bad-piggies-rovios-next-game-will-let-you-play-as-the-pigs-launches-september-27/">Bad Piggies for a while</a>, but only a lucky few have actually played the game. Quite a bit hinges on it. As you justly may have forgotten, Amazing Alex (Rovio&#8217;s <em>other</em> game) hasn&#8217;t exactly made a splash. According to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/26/net-us-angrybirds-piggies-idUSBRE88P0XG20120926">Finnish analyst firm Alekstra</a>, Rovio&#8217;s revenue is dropping like a rock as of late.</p>
<p>In response, Ville Heijari (VP Franchise Development) had this to say:</p>
<p>&#8220;Rovio today is highly diversified among games, consumer goods, and other entertainment areas. Throughout 2012, we have had a seen very healthy growth across our whole business, and we are not dependent on any single revenue stream.&#8221;</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s not focus too much on the negative — today is Bad Piggies&#8217; birthday, and it&#8217;s cause for celebration. After all, it&#8217;s the first time that we&#8217;ll be empathizing with the long-time antagonists.</p>
<p>The game is still very much based around physics, like Angry Birds and Cut The Rope. However, there&#8217;s no destruction here. Instead, your goal is get the Bad Piggies from Point A on a map to Point B.</p>
<p>You do this by constructing various contraptions — vehicles, really — that help the Piggies travel. Remember, pigs can&#8217;t <em>actually</em> fly, despite the information to the contrary.</p>
<p>As you travel through the map, you grab various collectibles (essentially the equivalent of eggs in Angry Birds) and are scored based on the three-star system.</p>
<p>The same things that made Angry Birds a huge success are present here in the Piggie version. You can complete levels relatively quickly, it isn&#8217;t all that hard to beat the levels, yet it&#8217;s still a mentally challenging game in terms of physics.</p>
<p>The game is available now in the <a target="_blank" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bad-piggies/id533451786?mt=8">Apple App Store</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rovio.BadPiggies">Google Play</a> for $.99. Here&#8217;s hoping the birds don&#8217;t get angrier as these pigs try to steal the show.</p>
