Today, Gizmodo reader Matt Van Gastel <a target="_blank" href="http://gizmodo.com/5947972/apple-acknowledges-iphone-5-camera-problem-says-youre-holding-it-wrong">received a response</a> from Apple&#8217;s engineering team routed through a support representative which essentially says that behavior isn&#8217;t cause for concern. According to the email from Apple:</p>
<blockquote><p>[W]e recommend that you angle the camera away from the bright light source when taking pictures. The purple flare in the image provided is considered normal behavior for iPhone 5&#8242;s camera.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, long-time Apple watchers will recognize this approach to dealing with what seem to be hardware problems with iPhones, since it&#8217;s very similar to what the company initially said about the iPhone 4&#8242;s reception issues, which was <a target="_blank" href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/24/apple-responds-over-iphone-4-reception-issues-youre-holding-th/">basically &#8216;you&#8217;re holding it wrong.</a>&#8216; But in this case, there&#8217;s reason to believe Apple might actually be correct. TechCrunch reader and photographer <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/aruisdante">Adam Panzica</a> explains in a note posted to our original story:</p>
<blockquote><p>As many others have stated, this kind of thing happens very frequently in cameras of all types. I actually remember there being a firmware update to my Canon 7D to address this issues with certain less and lighting combinations. It&#8217;s a result of certain light frequencies being reflected/refracted in the lens from the off-angle light source. It might look like lens flare on a larger glass, but on something this thin it&#8217;s probably always going to look like a purple haze. You simply cannot beat the laws of physics. High end DSLRs have whole image processors a hell of a lot more advanced than the one in a cellphone dedicated to removing this kind of thing. But it still shows up from time to time, especially with new glass.</p></blockquote>
<p>The bad news, as Adam points out, is that it&#8217;s largely unavoidable, at least in terms of getting rid of it completely. The good news is that as mentioned, it&#8217;s the type of effect that&#8217;s been addressed or improved elsewhere via firmware update, so Apple could potentially develop a way to compensate for it occurring in iPhone 5 in later versions of iOS, and it might even go away with time.</p>
<p>In the meantime, this is more of a nuisance bug than a game-ender; I&#8217;ve yet to have it happen to my photos in the general course of taking pictures, other than when I was trying to make it happen. The response from Apple&#8217;s customer support team may not be particularly comforting to those who are seeing this problem with any frequency, but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it&#8217;s the last word from Apple on the matter of the purple haze.</p>
