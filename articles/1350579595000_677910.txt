In total, Motorola revenues account for 18 percent of Google&#8217;s Q3 report. </p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/19/google-beats-in-q2-2012-revenue-up-35-percent-to-12-21b-2-79b-in-net-income/">Last quarter</a>, Motorola brought in a comfy $1.25 billion for Google, and yet still Motorola grows to now account for 18 percent of Google&#8217;s revenue as opposed to last quarter&#8217;s 10 percent. </p>
<p>Google acquired Motorola for $12.5 billion in<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/15/breaking-google-buys-motorola-for-12-5-billion/">August</a>. Since, Motorola has been enjoying the partnership launching three new smartphones with the help of Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt on stage. </p>
<p>In fact, two of those phones went <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/18/superphone-battle/">on sale today</a> with a big splash from Verizon. </p>
<p>Despite Motorola&#8217;s growth within Google, the company actually missed in earnings today reporting revenue up 45 percent to $14.10 billion, and a 20 percent decrease in net income to $2.1 billion. </p>
