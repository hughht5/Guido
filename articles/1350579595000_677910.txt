In total, Motorola revenues account for 18 percent of Google&#8217;s Q3 report. </p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/19/google-beats-in-q2-2012-revenue-up-35-percent-to-12-21b-2-79b-in-net-income/">Last quarter</a>, Motorola brought in a comfy $1.25 billion for Google, and yet still Motorola grows to now account for 18 percent of Google&#8217;s revenue as opposed to last quarter&#8217;s 10 percent. </p>
<p>Still, Motorola is accounting for major losses within Google as well, reporting a GAAP operating loss of $527 million ($505 million of which came from mobile), a 20 percent decrease in revenues. </p>

<p>Google acquired Motorola for $12.5 billion in<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/15/breaking-google-buys-motorola-for-12-5-billion/">August</a>. Slowly but surely, Google has been engulfing Motorola whole, replacing longtime CEO Sanjay Jah with Googler Dennis Woodside, and even having Executive Chairman <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/05/live-from-motorolas-on-display-android-press-conference/">Eric Schmidt on stage</a> to launch some new phones. </p>
<p>In fact, two of those phones went <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/18/superphone-battle/">on sale today</a> with a big splash from Verizon. </p>
<p>But according to the report Google has offset the hire of 1,807 Googlers with the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/google-offsets-new-hires-with-motorola-layoffs-2012-10-18">layoffs of 2,865 jobs at Motorola</a> in the third quarter alone. Motorola&#8217;s headcount is down from 54,604 at the end of June to 53,546 today. </p>
<p>Despite Motorola&#8217;s growth within Google, the company actually missed in earnings today reporting revenue up 45 percent to $14.10 billion, and a 20 percent decrease in net income to $2.1 billion. As a result Google stock <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/18/googles-stock-takes-a-dive-after-mid-day-earnings-release-trading-halted/">tanked 10 percent</a> before trading halted. </p>
