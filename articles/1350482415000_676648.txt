<p>If you haven&#8217;t yet heard about <a target="_blank" href="https://www.aereo.com/">Aereo</a>, and you live in New York, you better put your listening ears on. Many of us New Yawkers don&#8217;t have TVs (for many reasons) and so we miss out on lots of network television unless we seek it out on Netflix (months later) or illegally (immediately). But Aereo has essentially found a way to shrink an HD TV antenna down to tiny, and the company licenses out these antennas to users for $12/mo.</p>
<p>This gives you access to approximately 20 network channels streamed in HD over the Internet, but until now that was limited to Apple-style Internet: iPads, iPhones, Apple TV (from a compatible device), Roku (with firmware 3.0 or higher), and the Safari browser. Today, Aereo is bringing its magic to all New York City-based PCs.</p>
<p>Check out the full list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firefox 11.0 or higher</li>
<li>Chrome latest version</li>
<li>Safari 5.0 or higher</li>
<li>Opera 12.0 or higher</li>
<li>Internet Explorer 9 or higher</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly Aereo has a real shot at disrupting cable television, and we&#8217;re glad to see this expansion at such a crucial time. But major TV networks <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/05/aereo-for-the-win/">aren&#8217;t so thrilled</a>. Aereo is being sued by a group of broadcasters that includes ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox for not paying them for the network access.</p>
<p>But <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/11/aereo-wins-injuction/">no worries</a>. Aereo says that the over-the-air signals are free to anyone who wants to buy a digital antenna, which is what they&#8217;ve built and are now licensing out to their own users.</p>
