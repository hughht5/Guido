For its first game, it <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jennifer-lopez-dancepad-caa-moonshark-qualcomm-342705">partnered with Jennifer Lopez</a>. For its second title, it&#8217;s working with a star of a very different type — Stan Lee, the comic book writer who co-created (with artists Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko) most of Marvel&#8217;s biggest characters, including Spider-Man, and who&#8217;s now chairman and chief creative officer at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.powentertainment.com">POW! Entertainment</a>.</p>
<p>Lee is supposed to take the stage at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.comikazeexpo.com">Comikaze Expo</a> (or, to use its full title, Stan Lee&#8217;s Comikaze Expo) this morning, where he&#8217;s going to announce his partnership with Moonshark and show a brief trailer of the upcoming game, which will be called <em>Verticus</em>. I got on the phone with Moonshark CEO Matt Kozlov yesterday to get some of the details.</p>
<p>Kozlov says the company doesn&#8217;t expect its partners to be game designers. Instead, Moonshark pairs up the big names with independent game developers (in this case, Dallas-based Controlled Chaos Studios). Lee helped to create and design the characters and plot — Kozlov speaks admiringly of Lee&#8217;s enthusiasm, and says that when he&#8217;s 89, he hopes to have &#8220;half the wit and energy&#8221; that Lee does.</p>
<p>The story concerns a group of evil aliens set on destroying the Earth called the Obliterators. The player takes on the role of the hero Verticus, who has to dive through the Earth&#8217;s core in order to save the planet. Kozlov says that it&#8217;s a superheroic spin on the concept of an &#8220;endless runner&#8221; — he calls it an &#8220;infinite faller.&#8221; Lee has had cameos in most of Marvel&#8217;s films, so he also appears as a character in <em>Verticus</em>, namely the commander who gives Verticus his mission.</p>
<p>The game will launch sometime this fall, Kozlov says. He also reports that Moonshark&#8217;s first game DancePad was a hit, becoming the No. 1 music game on the iPad and the No. 2 on the overall gaming charts.</p>
<p>&#8220;It showed that our model works,&#8221; Kozlov says. &#8220;By putting great Hollywood talent together with great games, we get to the top of the charts.&#8221;</p>
