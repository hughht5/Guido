<img width="100" height="62" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/walmart.png?w=100&amp;h=62&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="Image (1) walmart.png for post 182923" title="Image (1) walmart.png for post 182923" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>The world&#8217;s largest retailer, Walmart, is today announcing its plans to test a &#8220;same-day&#8221; delivery service in select markets called &#8220;Walmart To Go.&#8221; The program, beginning now, will run through the holiday season and will be available in Northern Virginia (outside D.C.), Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and San Jose/San Francisco. During the test period, shoppers will be able to go online to shop for items like toys, electronics, sporting goods and other gifts, and then have them delivered to their address on the same day.</p>
<p>Walmart is charging a $10 feed for an unlimited number of items, with no minimum purchase required, and is working with UPS to deliver the orders. To get started, users in the supported markets first visit <a target="_blank" href="www.walmart.com/togo">www.walmart.com/togo</a> and enter in their delivery address in order to create an account. They can then browse the &#8220;Walmart to Go&#8221; selection of goods specific to their location &#8211; in other words, it&#8217;s not the entire Walmart online catalog that&#8217;s becoming available. The eligible items will be priced the same as those in the local stores.</p>
<p>In fact, the items available are the source for order fulfillment during this test. Customers can place orders up until noon in their timezone, and then choose a 4-hour windows to take delivery that same day (i.e., 4-8 pm, 5-9 pm, 6-10 pm). For returns, customers can choose to take the item back to the store, refuse delivery, or schedule the courier to retrieve the time.</p>
<p>The test is an extension of the &#8220;Walmart to Go&#8221; grocery delivery service first launched in San Jose/San Francisco in April 2010, but expands on that to offer general merchandise. The announcement comes at a time when several online retailers, big and small, are beginning to experiment with local same-day delivery options.</p>
<p>For example, in August, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/05/ebay-is-launching-a-same-day-shipping-service-called-ebay-now/">eBay invited San Francisco residents to test</a> a similar service called <a target="_blank" href="https://now.ebay.com/">eBay Now</a>. But more importantly, it comes at a time when Amazon has been pegged as considering a same-day option as well. Later, AmazonÂ CFO Tom Szkutak downplayed speculation on the matter, saying that the company doesn&#8217;t see a way to do same-day delivery on a broad scale economically. (That doesn&#8217;t mean it won&#8217;t, of course, do it on a small scale.)</p>
<p>The launch dates for Walmart&#8217;s program are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Northern Virginia (outside DC): 10/2</li>
<li>Philadelphia: 10/4</li>
<li>Minneapolis: 10/9</li>
<li>San Jose/San Francisco: late October/early November</li>
</ul>
