<p>Whenever you hover over one of these authors&#8217; names, you will see their top articles related to your search query, as well as a link to their Twitter page. The sidebar also allows Bing users to see all of a writer&#8217;s articles by clicking on the aptly named &#8220;See all articles&#8221; link.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">According to Bing, the team is &#8221; just beginning to surface the countless number of authors out there to build this feature&#8221; and will continue to add new authors and author pages over time.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Google, of course, has long been offering a similar feature and currently highlightsÂ <a target="_blank" href="http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=1408986">author information</a> right on its search results pages and on Google News. These results also include a link to the writer&#8217;s Google+ profile and a link to a list of all of the author&#8217;s articles. Google is officially still piloting this program, but it&#8217;s pretty easy for authors to <a target="_blank" href="http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=1408986">add their names to the list</a>. Microsoft, on the other hand, seems to be more interested in manually curating a list of &#8220;experts in their field.&#8221;</p>
