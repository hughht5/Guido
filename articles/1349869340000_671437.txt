There&#8217;s no word yet on whether Samsung plans to bring the device to the U.S.</p>
<p>The only other confirmed detail at this point is the name of the phone: the Galaxy S III mini. Samsung provided TechCrunch with the following statement confirming the planned launched</p>
<blockquote><p>GALAXY S III mini will come with 4&#8243; display and we are going to unveil the product tomorrow (Oct 11th). – JK Shin, head of <em>Samsung</em> Mobile Communications</p></blockquote>
<p>We&#8217;ve asked Samsung for more details about the phone and will update with any response.</p>
<p>Reuters&#8217; story quotes a Samsung spokeswoman citing Shin saying: &#8220;We think there&#8217;s strong demand for 4-inch screen models in Europe.&#8221; The company also told the news agency that the Galaxy S III mini would not be an entry-level model &#8212; suggesting a smaller screen size could be the only change Samsung plans to make for this version of the flagship.</p>
<p>Early last month <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/06/samsung-20m-galaxy-s-iii-red-herring-benchmark/">Saumsung released sales figures for the Galaxy S III</a> &#8211; saying it had sold over 20 million units in the first 100 days of launch: 6 million in Europe, 4.5 million in Asia (ex. Korea), 4 million in North America and 2.5  million in Korea. The company is clearly hoping to maximise the reach of the device by adding a smaller version to appeal to people with smaller hands (and pockets).</p>
<p>Samsung is also not the only mobile maker to be thinking (a little bit) smaller when it comes to smartphone screen sizes. Motorola&#8217;s recent <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/05/hands-on-with-the-droid-razr-m-the-reversal-of-big-phone-syndrome-feels-wonderful/">Droid Razr M</a> packs a 4.3 inch screen &#8212; putting in <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/07/the-razr-m-motorolas-clever-answer-to-the-99-iphone-4s/">the same ballpark as the iPhone</a>, albeit still a smidge bigger. Perhaps the rampant screen inflation we&#8217;ve seen in the smartphone market in recent years has just about run its course (let&#8217;s hope so).</p>
<p>The Galaxy S III is just one of scores of phones in Samsung&#8217;s portfolio &#8212; which run the gamut from kid-friendly devices with very small and cramped screens all the way up to &#8216;phablet&#8217; devices, its Galaxy Note range, with can pack screens <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/29/samsung-note-2/">in excess of 5 inches</a>.</p>
<p>Offering an extensive range of different screen sizes (and price points) has been one of the ways Samsung has differentiated its Android-powered smartphones from other Android-based devices, such as HTC&#8217;s. It&#8217;s also a counterpoint to Apple&#8217;s strategy of offering just a handful of iPhone models with only very limited choice in screen size (and price).</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/10/10/samsung-galaxy-s-iii-mini/">Engadget</a> has some leaked info on the device (via a German site called <a target="_blank" href="http://mobilegeeks.de/samsung-galaxy-s3-mini-alle-spezifikationen-erstes-foto/">MobileGeeks</a>) which suggests the S III mini may be rather more mid-range than flagship &#8212; with an expected price of 399 euros ($510). While it will apparently have a 4 inch Super AMOLED display, the resolution will only be 800 x 480 (which would give a lowly pixel per inch rate of 233).</p>
<p>The site also reckons Samsung is replacing the S III&#8217;s quad-core Exynos processor with an STE U8420 chip clocked at 1GHz. RAM is 1GHz, while the rear camera is reportedly 5 megapixels.</p>
