That&#8217;s what a few of the analysts on today&#8217;s earnings conference call seemed to be asking, albeit with some convoluted, finance-focused questions.</p>
<p>The context is a disappointing third quarter earnings report. While sales continue to grow, profits have not been doing the same, with Amazon only bringing in $7 million of net income during Q2, and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/25/amazon-q3-earnings/">showing a $274 million loss</a> in Q3. Investor Marc Andreessen has actually praised <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/02/marc-andreessen-facebook-monetization/">Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos for not focusing on profits</a>, but analysts today asked for some sense that the investments are actually paying off.</p>
<p>First, CFO Tom Szkutak was asked specifically about Amazon&#8217;s Kindle devices. Amazon isn&#8217;t making much of a profit on the devices themselves, and instead <a target="_blank" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/amazon-takes-pages-from-apple-playbook-2012-09-06">sees Kindle sales as a path to making more money later</a> by selling digital content. So what kind of sales lift are we actually seeing? Szkutak said he couldn&#8217;t offer any specific numbers beyond the earnings report (which stated that Amazon&#8217;s total media sales grew 11 percent from last year, to $4.6 billion), but suggested in general terms that the numbers are good: &#8220;We like what we see there. That&#8217;s why we continue to invest in that business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Towards the end of the call, another analyst asked whether Amazon is just philosophically inclined to aim for a small operating margin. Are there an &#8220;infinite&#8221; number of things for the company to spend money on, meaning it will always increase spending to match revenue? Hard to say, since Szkutak didn&#8217;t even address the issue, choosing instead to focus on a separate question asked by the same analyst.</p>
<p>However, the next (and final) analyst on the call asked something in the same vein. He suggested that Amazon is now a couple of years into a period of heavy investing, so he asked: &#8220;When can we start seeing returns on this in terms of revenue?&#8221; When might the &#8220;financial ratios&#8221; start to turn around?</p>
<p>Again, Szkutak said he couldn&#8217;t offer any specifics on Amazon&#8217;s returns on invested capital. Instead, he quickly rattled off each of Amazon&#8217;s businesses, for example noting that it&#8217;s delivering &#8220;great returns&#8221; in retail, and said, &#8220;We feel very good about the opportunity&#8221; as the media business becomes increasingly digital. In terms of geographic growth, he noted that Amazon is investing heavily in China, but he said analysts should think of that as &#8220;more of a long-term opportunity&#8221; that won&#8217;t see immediate returns.</p>
