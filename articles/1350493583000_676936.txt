Until now, just a few partners had access.</p>
<p>Facebook is making a big bet on the app economy, and wants to be the top source of discovery outside of the app stores.</p>
<p>The ads are working already. One client TinyCo saw a 50% higher click through rate and higher conversion rates compared to other paid install channels. Facebook&#8217;s ads brought in more engaged users. Ads tech startup Nanigans has attained 8-10X more reach for its clients with Facebook mobile app install ads.</p>
<p>A few design lessons were learned in the trial that started 2 months ago. People can&#8217;t go on an app&#8217;s name, short description  and icon alone. They want social proof that hey should download. That&#8217;s why the ads now show an app&#8217;s ratings from the Facebook App Center, as well as which friend use it.</p>
<p>Now to be clear, these are still non-social ads. They don&#8217;t require a friend to have Liked or installed the app for an ad to reach your news feed. That means Facebook has to be careful not to show too many, or it risks drowning out organic friend content.</p>
<p>But if users dig them, this could be the great mobile hope for Facebook&#8217;s bottom line. Mobile app installs are a huge industry. With the time spent on Facebook&#8217;s own apps, these ads could make sure any time a company launches a new app, it&#8217;s paying Facebook.</p>
