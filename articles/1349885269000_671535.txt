But when audiophiles go aquatic, options become much more limited.</p>
<p>Enter the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ecoxgear.com/ecoxbt/">ECOXBT waterproof speaker</a>. It&#8217;ll take you from the pool to the lake to the beach and back again with no trouble at all.</p>
<p>It floats speakers to the surface of the water, and just in case I wasn&#8217;t clear before, it&#8217;s entirely waterproof.</p>
<p>The speaker has standard audio input via a 3.5mm jack, along with Bluetooth, though the company didn&#8217;t specify the range. It shouldn&#8217;t be an issue floating by a boat or a dock, but brave ocean explorers may have issues if they venture far from shore.</p>
<p>Of course, this could be solved with a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/21/meet-the-nuud-lifeproofs-new-waterproof-ultra-rugged-ipad-case/">LifeProof</a> iPhone case.</p>
<p>The ECOXBT has battery life for 10 hours of playback time, and has controls on top for power, pairing, and volume. As an added bonus, a waterproof mic is integrated into the speaker, for which there is also an &#8220;answer/end&#8221; button.</p>
<p>The launch date is somewhat questionable, considering that summer is over. Pick one of these up for $129 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ecoxgear.com/ecoxbt/">here</a>.</p>
