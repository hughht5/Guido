Gartner predicts that we will see 1 billion smartphones sold in 2015, with a further 350 million media tablets sold by that time (as a point of comparison it looks like worldwide PC sales will be under 400 million units this year, using Gartner&#8217;s figures).</p>
<p>And it also wrapped those up with a list of suggestions of what services may still have some growing to do.</p>
<p>One of the standout areas are <strong>social networking features</strong>. Given how popular services like Facebook and Twitter are today &#8212; Facebook says that 40% of its active users, or 400 million people, currently use mobile devices to access the site; Twitter says that half of all usage of its site comes from smartphones &#8212; it&#8217;s surprising to see that on the whole only about 15% of mobile phone users are using social networking on their mobile devices, according to Gartner figures.</p>
<p>That is apparently changing fast, Gartner says, with mainstream adoption happening in the next two years, so that by 2014, there will be 1 billion people accessing social networks on their mobile devices. It&#8217;s not clear who will be the leaders, but it may not be who is on top today. &#8220;The market is crowded and users can be mercurial, so expect volatility, keeping a particular eye on acquisitions and the inevitable disruptions (small and large),&#8221; write Gartner analysts Sandy Shen and Mike McGuire.</p>
<p>And while Facebook and Twitter continue to make ever more inroads into mobile, the so-called pure-play mobile social networks &#8212; think Path, Instagram, Foursquare, Mocospace and networks from China like Mobile QQ here &#8212; will also continue to gain ground, if also with a bit of consolidation: there will only be about 4-5 players worth noting by 2015, Gartner says.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile app stores</strong>, meanwhile, are continuing to be a popular way for users to get what they want on their phones &#8212; Google Play for example hit <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/26/google-play-store-25-billion-app-downloads/">25 billion downloads</a> in September &#8212; but Gartner thinks apps will reach a &#8220;plateau of productivity&#8221; in its Hype Cycle soon: within the next two years in fact.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean that Gartner doesn&#8217;t think app stores are going to continue to be a hugely used resource by consumers, but that we may not see it grow much bigger after that period&#8230; and perhaps decline. It also means that while publishing an app today is definitely not a surefire success, that balance between hit and miss will probably become even more lopsided in the years ahead.</p>
<p>More on the upswing of the growth curve are <strong>location-based services</strong>. Like social networking, these can snag in a lot of different services &#8212; one could even argue that just about every mobile app, because its on mobile, should have location-based features worked into them. But for the purposes of its predictions, Gartner has limited its scope to pure location services, be they mapping or check-in services from the likes of Google, Nokia, and Skyhook, or Foursquare. It believes that by the end of this year, there will be 800 million people using such apps.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t reveal a user number for 2015, but does note location-based services will be generating revenues of $13.5 billion by that time, driven by navigation and location search, as well as friend-finding apps that link into social networking features. Highlight is one of the more popular that offer such services already; and Facebook is likely to play a role here, too: Facebook has <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/24/friendshake-facebooks-new-mobile-feature-for-finding-people-nearby-and-a-highlight-killer/">already been experimenting</a> with &#8220;Find Friends Nearby&#8221; features on its mobile apps.</p>
<p>Lastly, <strong>mobile advertising</strong> is another big area for Gartner: Shen and McGuire say that this is due, yes, to smartphones and tablets, which provide a lot more opportunity to explore different formats and get used significantly more than basic feature phones did. Given that smartphones will reach 1 billion units sold by 2015, and tablets will reach 350 million units sold, these numbers will make mobile advertising &#8220;nearly indispensable for advertisers.&#8221;</p>
<p>But that won&#8217;t necessarily be translating to indispensable value, yet. Gartner says that by 2015 mobile ads will account for only 4% of all ad expenditures &#8212; although that&#8217;s still good compared to less than 1% today. That works out to a value of $20.6 billion &#8212; a 12-fold increase compared to today, the analysts say. Key players to keep watching in mobile ads are Google, Apple, Greystripe, Jumptap, Microsoft, Millennial Media, Velti and Yahoo, Gartner says.</p>
<p><strong>What else is still to come?</strong> Gartner names three things that are still niche and growing: bar code marketing, mobile coupons and augmented reality. All three share some common features: a lack of consumer awareness, slow adoption and often-poor user experience. (These are my opinions, not Gartner&#8217;s.)  Bar codes, Gartner believes, could become &#8220;mainstream&#8221; within 2-5 years. Mobile coupon adoption has been &#8220;slow&#8221; and augmented reality reached its hype cycle two years ago (when it was, as it is now, still niche). Whether efforts by Apple with its Passbook service, or Facebook pushing<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/20/an-offer-you-cant-refuse-facebook-adds-barcodes-new-ad-buying-requirement-to-its-offers-coupon-product/"> further into coupons</a>, or Google and its ambitions to do ever more integrating services like Goggles and Wallet, helps turn these challenges around remains to be seen.</p>
