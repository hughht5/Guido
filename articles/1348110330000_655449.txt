Why? Well the app is kind of wonky, it doesn&#8217;t have StreetView, and it looks and feels like a twee designer&#8217;s vision of a ratty road atlas &#8211; hard to read yet surprisingly calming.</p>
<p>A new Twitter account <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/iOS6maps">@iOS6maps</a> is offering a bit of levity by tweeting things that we can assume the Apple Maps team would say.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Sadly, not everyone gets the joke:</p>
<blockquote class='twitter-tweet'><p>Really apple?disgusting &quot;@<a href="https://twitter.com/iOS6maps">iOS6maps</a>: we left out transit directions because only losers take public transport. All iPhone owners drive BMWs&mdash; <br />fadjri mohammad (@fadjri) <a href='http://twitter.com/#!/fadjri/status/248596372549431296' data-datetime='2012-09-20T01:36:08+00:00'>September 20, 2012</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I am honestly not a huge fan of the new Maps, either &#8211; turn by turn directions can sometimes go painfully awry and many of the complaints are valid. It&#8217;s nice to see a bit of levity here.</p>
<p>UPDATE &#8211; Just before I published this, Twitter suspended the account. It really warms the heart to see a vanguard of interaction and free speech come down this hard on a parody account. Watch out, <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com//niceryanlawler">@niceryanlawler</a>. You&#8217;re next.</p>
