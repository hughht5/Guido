<p>It&#8217;s the big day. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/18/iphone-5-review/">iPhone 5</a> day.</p>
<p>The fanbois — not the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/17/apple-announces-record-pre-orders-for-iphone-5-2m-in-24-hours/">2 million that pre-ordered</a> within the first 24 hours, but the rest of them — have <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/20/in-line-for-the-iphone-5-where-have-all-the-fanbois-gone/">only recently showed up</a> to Apple&#8217;s Fifth Avenue flagship store in New York City. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/20/meet-romain-techcrunchs-fearless-vlogger-in-line-for-the-iphone-5/">Romain&#8217;s here</a>. Still.</p>
<p>And of course, the same group of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/20/in-line-for-the-iphone-5-where-have-all-the-fanbois-gone/">brand ambassadors and OccupyApple protestors</a> are still at the head of the line, some pushing their app/cases/services and others trying to sell off their valuable spot in line.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s us.</p>
<p>We arrived around 6am, and it&#8217;s pretty chilly, but that doesn&#8217;t seem to bother those waiting in line. We now have about an hour left until a bunch of so-called geniuses have some sort of pow-wow before forming a line and clapping, as the first new iPhone 5 owners make their way into the store.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll try and interview the first guy out with a phone, who, if I recall correctly, is from Vibe.</p>
<p>Make sure to tweet and follow along with us on Twitter using the hashtag #crunchphone. We will do our best to answer questions as we wander around.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy the show.</p>
