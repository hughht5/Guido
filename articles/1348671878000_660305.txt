<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/delivernow.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="delivernow" title="delivernow" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>This past summer, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.taskrabbit.com">TaskRabbit</a>, the online marketplace letting people outsource errands and odd jobs, unveiled <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/21/taskrabbit-on-demand-deliver-now-service/">a feature extension for its iPhone app</a> called &#8220;Deliver Now,&#8221; which lets users get on-demand delivery of anything within the city of San Francisco on weekdays between 9am and 7pm. </p>
<p>Starting today, it won&#8217;t be just iPhone users in San Francisco that can enjoy on-demand <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dynamodonut.com/">Dynamo Donuts</a> (or <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tartinebakery.com/">Tartine</a> croissants, or a new pair of socks, or whatever) within an hour without leaving the comfort of their apartments. </p>
<p>This morning TaskRabbit is launching a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.taskrabbit.com/deliver-now">web-based version of Deliver Now</a>, which will be accessible at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.taskrabbit.com/deliver-now">TaskRabbit.com/Deliver-Now</a>. This means that anyone with a computer or smartphone and a Wi-Fi connection can use the Deliver Now feature.</p>
<p>The other major player in this space is the urban logistics startup <a target="_blank" href="http://www.postmates.com">Postmates</a>, which also debuted an <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/17/postmates-debuts-get-it-now-on-demand-courier-service-to-the-public/">on-demand courier service to San Francisco residents</a> with an iPhone app this past summer. Today&#8217;s launch, however, makes TaksRabbit the first to launch an on-demand courier option to anyone on the web.<br />
Meanwhile, more scaling is on the way: The people at TaskRabbit tell me that they&#8217;re planning to roll out Deliver Now to other markets &#8220;in the next few months.&#8221;   </p>
<p>And indeed, what will be really interesting to see is how these services scale to cities beyond San Francisco. The city by the Bay is a great hub for early adopters, but it is relatively tiny &#8212; famously just <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco,_California">47 square miles</a>, with a population of some 800,000 people. Promising reliable and snappy deliveries in a more sprawling and populated metropolis on the order of London, New York, or Chicago will really put these on-demand apps to the test. </p>
<p>Here are a couple of screenshots of Deliver Now for the web in action (click to enlarge):<br />
