<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/delivernow.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="delivernow" title="delivernow" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>This past summer, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.taskrabbit.com">TaskRabbit</a>, the online marketplace letting people outsource errands and odd jobs, unveiled <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/21/taskrabbit-on-demand-deliver-now-service/">a feature extension for its iPhone app</a> called &#8220;Deliver Now,&#8221; which let users get on-demand delivery of anything within the city of San Francisco on weekdays between 9am and 7pm. </p>
<p>Starting today, it won&#8217;t be just iPhone users in San Francisco that can enjoy on-demand <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dynamodonut.com/">Dynamo Donuts</a> (or <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tartinebakery.com/">Tartine</a> croissants, or a new pair of socks, or whatever) within an hour without leaving the comfort of their apartments. </p>
<p>This morning TaskRabbit is launching a web-based version of Deliver Now, which will be accessible at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.TaskRabbit.com/DeliverNow">TaskRabbit.com/DeliverNow</a>. This means that anyone with a computer or smartphone and a Wi-Fi connection can use the Deliver Now feature.</p>
<p>The other major player in this space is the urban logistics startup <a target="_blank" href="http://www.postmates.com">Postmates</a>, which also debuted an <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/17/postmates-debuts-get-it-now-on-demand-courier-service-to-the-public/">on-demand courier service to San Francisco residents</a> with an iPhone app this past summer. Today&#8217;s launch, however, makes TaksRabbit the first to launch an on-demand courier option to anyone on the web.  </p>
<p>While this pulls TaskRabbit ahead in terms of potential user reach for the moment, what will be really interesting to see is how and when these services scale to cities beyond San Francisco. The city by the Bay is a great hub for early adopters, but it is relatively tiny &#8212; famously just <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco,_California">47 square miles</a>, with a population of some 800,000 people. Promising reliable and snappy deliveries in a more sprawling and populated metropolis on the scale of London, New York, or Chicago will really put these services to the test. </p>
