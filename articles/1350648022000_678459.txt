<p>Specifically, SiteScout says that it has now powered 30,000 campaigns for 5,000 advertisers, and that its revenue has grown 375 percent year-over-year compared to 2011. The company isn&#8217;t sharing the actual revenue numbers, but I hear from a source that SiteScout&#8217;s revenue was $20 million for the fiscal year running from the third quarter of 2011 to the same period in 2012.</p>
<p>(This SiteScout, by the way, is not the same SiteScout that was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/25/the-rubicon-project-buys-malware-security-company-sitescout/">acquired by ad company The Rubicon Project</a> back in 2010.)</p>
<p>SiteScout aims its product at small and medium-sized businesses, offering them a self-serve, demand-side platform for buying banner and video ads on both the web and mobile apps. Features include &#8220;up-to-the-minute&#8221; campaign reports, a relatively small financial commitment (the minimum deposit is $500), fast sign-up (you should be able to get a campaign started in minutes), and access to technologies like retargeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Back in 2010, we recognized there was a void in the digital ad-buying space, especially for small to mid-sized advertisers,&#8221; said founder and CEO Paul Mokbel in a press release. &#8220;We built SiteScout to change the industry and make online advertising easier and more accessible to SMBs.&#8221;</p>
