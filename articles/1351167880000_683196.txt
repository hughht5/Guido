But earlier this year, it introduced the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/slr_cameras/eos_m_ef_m_22mm_stm_kit">EOS M</a>, its first MILC offering. That camera should hit store shelves by the end of this month, but I got to take it for a brief test drive at an event last night ahead of this week&#8217;s PhotoPlus conference in New York.</p>
<p>The EOS M is a surprisingly small camera. It probably seemed even more so because I was using it initially with Canon&#8217;s 24-70mm f/2.8 L lens attached via the official adapter ring (which brings with it full autofocus functionality by the way), but with the EF-M 22mm f/2 kit lens attached it&#8217;s actually pretty pocketable. It reminds me a lot of a bulkier PowerShot S100, right down to the very nice feeling matte magnesium alloy body. Also, I noticed that the 22mm lens is actually a very dark shade of grey, whereas the body is black. That&#8217;s on purpose, a Canon rep told me, and meant to ensure the lens complements both the white and black EOS M body.</p>
<p>One thing about the EOS M that immediately takes a little getting used to is the lack of physical controls, especially if you&#8217;re coming from a Canon DSLR. Much of the camera&#8217;s settings are managed via its capacitive touchscreen, which is incredibly responsive and provides convenient access to Canon&#8217;s well-designed software menu system. That said, pros will find themselves missing all the dials and buttons of their DSLR rigs, and advanced consumers might long for the lens-based control ring of the PowerShot S100 and new S110, but that&#8217;s not an issue of the EOS M&#8217;s design, it&#8217;s the result of design compromises needed to provide a MILC camera that&#8217;s uncluttered yet also small enough to be truly portable. Plus, using the touchscreen to review images, with its pinch-to-zoom features, is a much better experience than I&#8217;ve had in the past with non-touch digital cameras.</p>
<p>We were working with a professionally lit display space when taking photos at this event, and that means you had a lot of different lighting conditions, but all designed to benefit photographs. And I found that the EOS M did take great pictures with its 18MP APS-C sensor (it shares both this and its touchscreen display with the Rebel T4i), but the camera took a while to find focus in all cases. With autofocus, whether you&#8217;re using face detection or tap-to-focus on the touchscreen, the EOS M hunts for a while before settling in – the sensor-based AF just can&#8217;t keep up with DSLRs. If you&#8217;re looking for a comparable experience, imagine shooting only in live view mode on the T3i or T4i, using the default autofocus settings.</p>
<p>The EOS M&#8217;s autofocus system is more geared towards shooting video, and in that capacity combined with the STM kit lens, it works very well. Though I can&#8217;t speak to final output quality based on my experience, shooting video was a very good experiences with Canon&#8217;s MILC.</p>
<p>Finally, while I didn&#8217;t get too much time with the EOS M, it&#8217;s a camera that feels great in the hand and that lives up to the expectations of the MILC category. Canon&#8217;s big advantage over others in this space may just be the adapter ring, which makes it possible to use the EOS M with Canon&#8217;s extensive catalog of EF lenses, a huge selling point for existing Canon DSLR shooters who want something more portable to shore up their collection.
