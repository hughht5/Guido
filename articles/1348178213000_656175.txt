<p>As <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/20/meet-romain-techcrunchs-fearless-vlogger-in-line-for-the-iphone-5/">Jordan told you earlier</a>, I am standing in the line for the iPhone 5. Unexpected buyers showed up as well. Occupy Wall Street demonstrators planned a strategy to hijack the event. They are currently standing in line and plan to sell their spots tomorrow morning to rich business people.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it Machiavellian and very capitalistic of them? Actually, no. They have a justification. &#8220;We are going to donate the money to charity,&#8221; said Ryan Lash, who has been doing Occupy demonstrations for a year. &#8220;If we tell them it&#8217;s for a donation, they will not buy our spots,&#8221; he continued.</p>
<p>Another person started interviewing me and live streaming it with — erm — his iPhone. Others looked bored more than anything else, drawing and reading to pass time. On the cardboard signs, one could read &#8220;Apple puts profits in offshore accounts so they can dodge paying taxes,&#8221; or &#8220;Its OK, keep buying things you dont need. #OccupyApple&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Technology should be free and incorporated into public services,&#8221; Lash said. If this reasoning can easily be defended for services, such as Internet access or mobile phone plans, companies design hardware products in order to sell them at a margin.</p>
<p>When asked what is the charity they selected, he told me that they haven&#8217;t figured it out yet. I will keep this short, it looks like it is going to rain. Be sure to catch our live stream of the doors opening starting tomorrow at 7am Eastern Time.</p>
<p>One last anecdote, I overheard an elderly woman saying from the sidewalk &#8220;God bless you for just waiting in line for that.&#8221;</p>
