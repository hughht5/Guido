<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/cameraipad.jpeg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="camera+ipad" title="camera+ipad" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p><a target="_blank" href="http://campl.us/">Camera+</a> is a consistently top-selling app in Apple&#8217;s iOS App Store, providing users with enhanced camera features and effects. Developer tap tap tap hopes that success will translate to the larger screen, today introducing <a target="_blank" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id550902799?mt=8">an iPad version</a> that also introduces iCloud syncing of photos between the iPhone and iPad apps. The app is a new standalone piece of software, not a universal update to the original iPhone version, and sells for $0.99 at launch.</p>
<p>The iPad version offers pretty much the same kind of features users are used to on the iPhone, including touch-up tools, filter effects like those found in Instagram, cropping and borders. Other features include a camera stabilization tool, timer and burst ode functions. Although the focus seems to be on editing and managing your library with this version of Camera+, as a complement to the iPhone version, there are no shortage of people taking photos direct from their iPad, as I can personally attest from recent vacations.</p>
<p>The iCloud-based library sycning puts Camera+ squarely in competitive territory with other cloud library management apps, like Adobe Revel, and even Apple&#8217;s own iCloud Photo Streams. But if there&#8217;s one thing Camera+ has proven over time, it&#8217;s that the app is capable of building significant success on top of a model that seems to just replicate existing function Apple already provides, with some minor tweaks and improvements. Camera+ has seen over 9 million sales on the App Store for iPhone, after all, and continues to enjoy good position in the charts despite having been around since 2010.</p>
