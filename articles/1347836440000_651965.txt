In one fell swoop, Apple made these obsolete when it launched its new <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/the-iphone-5-comes-with-the-new-lightning-connector/">Lightning connector</a> on Wednesday. In typical Apple fashion, the company didn&#8217;t just replace its old proprietary connector it introduced in 2003 with a standards-compliant one. Instead, it went with its own design. The Lightning connector is significantly smaller than the old 30-pin connector, but the one feature that Apple really seemed to feel the need to stress is that it&#8217;s &#8220;reversible&#8221; (because plugging in the old connector was always so hard).</p>
<p>If you made any <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/14/apple-is-creating-an-e-waste-problem/">investment in iPod/iOS hardware ecosystem</a> in the last 10 years, chances are you will need to buy a few of Apple&#8217;s overpriced $29 adapters (or $39 with a cable) so you can keep using your devices.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/16/nice-phone-apple-but-whats-the-deal-with-the-29-lightning-to-30-pin-adapter/lightning-cables/" rel="attachment wp-att-651985"></a>With millions of devices ranging from simple speaker docks to clock radios and all the way up to cars featuring 30-pin dock connectors, most people probably would have preferred for Apple to keep the old connector anyway. But time obviously moves on and Apple had good reasons to switch to a new and smaller plug. But going with yet another proprietary connector is a step backwards, and the $29 price feels like a slap in the face to the company&#8217;s long-time supporters.</p>
<p>Apple wouldn&#8217;t be Apple if it just sold the adapter for a more reasonable $9, but its users (and all those hotels, car manufacturers and others that only recently started investing in accessories with 30-pin connectors) would surely appreciate it.</p>
<p>In Europe, where Micro USB is now the standard for all phones, Apple offers a <a target="_blank" href="http://store.apple.com/uk/product/MD820ZM/A/lightning-to-micro-usb-adapter?fnode=48">Lightning to Micro USB adapter</a> and currently bundles a Micro USB adapter for its old dock connector with all of its phones there to comply with this standard. As far as I can see, neither the old nor the new adapters are available in the U.S. store.</p>
<p>The fact that converting Lightening to USB is apparently no problem for Apple makes it even more annoying that Apple didn&#8217;t just go with a standard USB plug to begin with. A regular Lightning to USB cable is &#8220;just&#8221; $19, which is a bit easier to stomach, but just to put that into perspective, a 6-foot USB to Micro USB cable costs <a target="_blank" href="http://www.monoprice.com/products/search.asp?spcDB=10303&amp;spcWord=USB+Cables&amp;keyword=micro%20usb">just under $1.50 on Monoprice.com</a>.</p>
<p>The USB adapter apparently doesn&#8217;t even support all of the Lightning and 30-pin connectors&#8217; features, but most Android OEMs seem to make do with them just fine and Apple could surely make Micro USB work for its purposes, too.</p>
<p>All of this obviously didn&#8217;t stop iPhone 5 pre-orders from <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/14/iphone-5-pre-order-sells-out-20x-faster-than-4-and-4s-further-highlighting-apples-dominance/">breaking records</a>, though most mainstream users probably aren&#8217;t even aware of this new adapter yet. I have to say that it did put a damper on my enthusiasm for the new iPhone, though, given that I will likely have to shell out a good $100 extra just to keep using my old accessories.</p>
