Their big <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/10/tesla-model-x/">Model X</a> debut was a success, their cars are pre-ordered to capacity, and new business opportunities are presenting themselves. They&#8217;re still posting a net loss, of course, but that was expected and will continue for another year or so.</p>
<p>Here are the most salient points from their latest earnings statement, released today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Total Q4 revenues: $39M (up 9% YOY)</li>
<li>Total 2011 revenues: $204M (up 75% vs. 2010)</li>
<li>Expected revenues for 2012: $550M-$600M (mostly in late 2012)</li>
<li>Operating expenses: $89M (GAAP)</li>
<li>Capital expenditures: $54M (mostly building production infrastructure)</li>
<li>Net Q4 losses: $81M (GAAP) or $0.78 per share on ~104M shares</li>
<li>Net 2011 losses: $264M (GAAP) or $2.53 per share</li>
<li>Beta Model S vehicles are being built at the nearly complete factory &#8211; 30 out of 50</li>
<li>Model S betas successfully do 0-60MPH in 4.5s</li>
<li>8000 total reservations for Model S</li>
<li>Model X debut caused 500 reservations, with $5000 commitment each</li>
<li>Model X to ship in late 2013 at around 10,000-15,000 units per year</li>
<li>New deal with Daimler to develop a new Mercedes all-electric powertrain</li>
<li>There are more Tesla battery packs at Daimler and Toyota than there are Roadsters</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything seems to be going according to plan. 2012 should see the Model S hit the streets (in July) and Tesla-developed batteries and powertrains ship in partners&#8217; vehicles. With luck we&#8217;ll have a chance to review the car and its interesting new dash system at that time.</p>
