Starting in early October, the novel camera is hitting Amazon.com, BestBuy.com and Target.com, along with select international CityTarget stores. The camera was previously only available from the company&#8217;s website, Lytro.com.</p>
<p>“Since introducing the Lytro camera just six months ago, nearly 400,000 light field pictures have been shared on Lytro.com. We are excited to take this picture revolution one step further by making Lytro available to more photographers in the US and around the world,” said Charles Chi, CEO of Lytro in a released statement today.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/12/review-lytro-lightfield-camera/">our March 2012 review</a> found the Lytro to be a fun, but ultimately, an unfinished product. Since then the company has rolled out several updates including support for Windows. But the product remains as novel as ever. </p>
<p>Unlike a traditional camera, a Lytro camera allows the photographer to adjust the point of focus after the picture is shot (see images below). This allows for unheard of flexibility. But with this comes lower picture quality. At least right now, that is. Eventually the technology should mature and offer its trademark flexibility with high-quality imaging.</p>
