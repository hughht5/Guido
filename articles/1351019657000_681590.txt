It&#8217;s clear that Apple wants this new version of its top-performer to take over as a product that redefines the laptop category, and judging by limited hands-ion experience, there&#8217;s good reason to believe they&#8217;ll eventually get their wish, though not just yet.</p>
<p>The 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro offers the same amazing display as its larger predecessor, but in a much smaller package, with a 2560&#215;1600 screen but with a starting price $500 less than the 15-inch notebook. That still doesn&#8217;t make it exactly affordable (consider that the non-retina version still starts at $999), but it does mean a lot more people will be able to get on board with a Retina-resolution notebook.</p>
<p>As for how it performed, it was very much like using the 15-inch rMBP, which is my main machine currently. In the hand, however, it feels significantly lighter, at about a pound lighter than the bigger model. That&#8217;s a big difference for a machine you carry around with you all day, and alone might sway some users, price considerations aside.</p>
<p>The reduced glare did seem to have an effect vs. previous versions of the screen, which definitely photographed better. And changing up the display resolution really gives you a ton of screen real estate at maximum settings for what is a very, very portable computer. So long as you&#8217;ve got good eyes, this could be a great solution for people looking for a work machine when they&#8217;re away from their dual-monitor setups.</p>
<p>Two Thunderbolt ports also mean you can plug it in at home and power up to two separate monitors at resolutions of 2560&#215;1600, another big bonus. Basically, if the 15-inch Retina MacBook Pro wasn&#8217;t the right machine for you, there&#8217;s a good chance the 13-inch is. But again, at that price it&#8217;s still not budget-friendly by any means, so while I expect significant sales beyond the 15-inch&#8217;s mostly niche pro market, I still don&#8217;t think this is the machine that supplants the regular 13-inch MacBook Pro as Apple&#8217;s top-seller.
