Earlier this year, Salesforce rebranded Rypple as <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/15/salesforce-tackles-talent-management-with-rypple-integration-debuts-site-com-as-a-simple-cms/">&#8220;Salesforce Rypple,&#8221;</a> but today the CRM giant is debuting a brand new Rypple, under the name Work.com.</p>
<p>For background, Rypple is a social performance management platform that helps managers and employees improve performance. Essentially, Rypple replaces the traditional performance review with a more social and collaborative approach. The software has been compared to a “Zynga for the enterprise,” and allows managers to track projects, guide their team and give kudos to deserving staff for others to see within its online application.</p>
<p>Employees and administrators can set goals, manage objectives, and provide feedback and recognition all from within their employee social network. Earlier this year, Salesforce debuted an integration with Rypple and Chatter, allowing users to create custom badges to recognize team and individual achievements that would appear in the Chatter feed.</p>
<p>With today&#8217;s launch of Work.com, Rypple becomes fully integrated with Chatter, the Sales Cloud and the Service Cloud. People Users can see colleagues’ goals, feedback and recognition inside Chatter or recognize work from within a Sales Cloud opportunity record. With Work.com, sales managers can onboard new reps more effectively and improve the productivity of their teams. Work.com employee social profiles reflect their expertise, goals and performance right inside Chatter, helping them build their reputation.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re told that the entire platform has been rebuilt from the ground-up, with a new user experience on the front end. Rypple is also debuting a new partnership with Amazon to allow companies to incentivize employees with Amazon gift cards. &#8220;We are integrating rewards directly into where people are doing work,&#8221; explains Rypple co-founder Daniel Debow.</p>
<p>Also announced today, a new partnership with Workday will enable seamless integration between Workday human capital management software and Work.com.</p>
<p>Additionally, Work.com has integrated enterprise perks management platform ChoicePass, which was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/18/choicepass-acquired-by-salesforce/">acquired</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>Already, Facebook, LinkedIn, LivingSocial, Spotify, Virgin America and 1-800 Flowers are using Work.com. The SaaS is scheduled to be generally available in calendar Q4 of this year.</p>
