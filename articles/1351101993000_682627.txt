Should I win a second term, a big reason I will win a second term is because the Republican nominee and the Republican Party have so alienated the fastest-growing demographic group in the country, the Latino community,&#8221; he <a target="_blank" href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20121024/NEWS09/121024003/After-editor-s-blog-President-Obama-releases-transcript-of-Register-interview?Frontpage&amp;nclick_check=1">told</a> the Iowa Des Moines register, while <del>begging</del> seeking their coveted endorsement in the swing state (<em>The Register</em> later publicized the transcript). Democratic favor for comprehensive immigration reform is well known, but the President&#8217;s candid remarks reveal a brazen politicized motivation.</p>
<p>The engineering-starved technology industry has made incremental high-skilled immigration reform a top priority. Companies are so desperate for engineers, Twitter CEO, Dick Costolo once <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/16/a-big-think-talk-with-eric-schmidt-and-dick-costolo/">admitted</a>, that top prospective employees often have the tech industry&#8217;s celebrity founders personally enticing them to join. Unable to satisfy demand from America&#8217;s graduates, they&#8217;ve aggressively lobbied to increase the number of work visas for top talent from other countries and foreign-born students graduating with STEM degrees.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/20/meritocracy-vs-diversity-impasse-stalls-last-hope-for-immediate-immigration-reform/">The latest attempt at increasing high-skilled visas</a>, The STEM Jobs Act, failed, in large part, because it did not satisfy Democrat&#8217;s demands support underprivileged immigrants. &#8220;Republicans are only willing to increase legal immigration for immigrants they want by eliminating legal immigration for immigrants they don’t want,&#8221; said Illinois Representative Luis Gutierrez.</p>
<p>In a similar fight a year ago, when Democratic members were asked why incremental high-skilled immigration reform wasn&#8217;t supported, Democratic Senators Blumenthal, Franken, and Schumer argued that there were too many other &#8216;stakeholders&#8217; that wanted to be included in any immigration reform, as <a target="_blank" href="http://washingtonindependent.com/110532/senators-agree-on-high-skilled-immigration-reform-but-democrats-insist-it-must-be-comprehensive">reported</a> by <em>The Iowa Independent</em>.</p>
<p>As the immigration reform fight continues, advocates within the technology industry will have to take political realities into account.</p>
