The Surface starts at $499 for an entry-level 32GB version without the Touch Cover with integrated touch-sensitive keyboard, while one with the cover runs $599. At the top of the line, a 64GB version with the touch cover included costs $699.</p>
<p>Microsoft had originally said that its Surface pricing would be roughly in line with the competition, with the RT devices matching tablets and the regular, more powerful Windows 8 varieties coming in at prices more comparable to other notebooks and ultrabooks out there. This pricing is in line with Apple&#8217;s iPad, which starts at $499 and ranges up to $699 for the Wi-Fi-only versions. Surface will be available beginning October 26, following a kick-off event for media October 25, and Microsoft looks to be ready to open pre-orders soon. The touch cover adds $119.99 to the price of the tablet when added as an accessory, and the type cover, with hardware keys, adds $129.99.</p>
<p>Earlier, the WSJ reported that Microsoft anticipated selling as many as <a title="Microsoft Betting Big On Surface: Orders 3 To 5 Million Tablets For Q4, SaysÂ WSJ" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/16/microsoft-betting-big-on-surface-orders-3-to-5-million-tablets-for-q4-says-wsj/">3 to 5 million of these tablets in Q4</a>, which is ambitious, but at least they&#8217;re not overpriced for the category. We&#8217;ll have to see whether users think there&#8217;s as much value there in Microsoft&#8217;s untested tablet as there is in Apple&#8217;s established lineup.</p>
