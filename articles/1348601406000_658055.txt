<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.angiehicksbowman.com/">Angie Hicks</a> is the co-founder and Chief Marking Officer of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/angies-list">Angie&#8217;s List</a> &#8211; the customer review service she helped found in Columbus, Ohio. At Angie&#8217;s List, subscribers find services and submit non-anonymous reviews on everything from medical care to home fix-up.</p>
<p>Angie&#8217;s List has exploded since the mid-90&#8242;s when Hicks was going door-to-door to solicit business. Last year the company went public on <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/25/local-reviews-site-angies-list-files-for-75-million-ipo/">the NASDAQ</a>. Angie&#8217;s List has listings in more than 200 US cities (along with parts of Canada) and more than 1.5 million households pay roughly $45 a year to access the site, 100,000 of them in New York City alone.</p>
<p>Recently Angie Hicks passed though Manhattan, and when she did, <a target="_blank" href="http://cdixon.org/">Chris Dixon</a> sat down with her to tape an episode of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/tag/founder-stories/"><em>Founder Stories</em></a>.</p>
<p>Hicks tells Dixon the idea to create a national service for people to &#8221;share information with one another, to find out who are the best providers in town&#8221; occurred after her co-founder had trouble locating help for home repairs. Surveying the landscape they found an Indianapolis-based company running a newsletter/call-in service that offered something along the lines of what they were seeking. They launched their own version and a year later acquired the company.</p>
<p>Hicks says the Internet is now &#8220;the driving force behind the service&#8221; but points out Angie&#8217;s List still sends out a magazine and fields calls, with Hicks personally answering some of those calls. Hicks credits the phone-in service as being particularly helpful to customers who need quick answers.</p>
<p>Reflecting upon lessons learned, Hicks mentions the strategic importance of rolling out early in big cities. Had Angie&#8217;s List not &#8220;danced around&#8221; opening in Chicago for example, Hicks says the company could have learned more, quicker.</p>
<p>Before wrapping, Hicks shares some advice her grandfather shared with her when she was debating joining the young startup. &#8220;He is like, Angie, what’s the difference between being 22 and looking for a job and being 23 and looking for a job? There’s nothing.&#8221;</p>
