The problem I noticed is that little, spinning loading indicator (or whatever you call it) at the top of mobile Safari which tells you when a site has finished loading all its parts. On some websites, that little guy just runs and runs, never completing, as if there&#8217;s still more to load. Kind of annoying, right?</p>
<p>Well, apparently, it&#8217;s not just a little annoying to picky users like me &#8211; it&#8217;s annoying developers too. It&#8217;s related to a bug which impacts how websites function, and is causing some web apps to not work properly.</p>
<p>The problem is related to something called long polling, and that&#8217;s something that affects your usage of a lot of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)">AJAX</a> web apps in Safari (apps that use HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as many modern-day web applications now do). I first noticed the issue on Google Readers&#8217; mobile site, then on Gmail&#8217;s mobile site, and on the Google+ mobile site. Oh yeah, and on Google Maps, of course. (Yep, I&#8217;m on Google stuff a lot). A <a target="_blank" href="http://www.realsoftwareblog.com/2012/09/ios-6-mobile-safari-web-applications.html">post by Greg O&#8217;Lone on the company blog for Real Software</a>, makers of cross-platform development tools, explains the problem. And while he doesn&#8217;t specifically discuss that annoying little spinning thing, it&#8217;s related to the same issue.</p>
<p>And really, the spinning thing is the least of developers&#8217; concerns here. Other problems may include things like missing images, unresponsive interfaces, and random disconnects, he says.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening. When a browser loads a website, it often has a few simultaneous connections going to pull for content. For example, images may be loaded at the same time as the main page content. Long polling, then, is something that&#8217;s used to show you new content (AJAX style) without the end user having to refresh the entire page. It does this by holding one connection open.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Lone says that in iOS 6, the normal process is all messed up, basically. Instead of letting an app and server use multiple connections, only one connection at a time is allowed. Because only one connection at time works, other requests &#8211; like those for images, for example &#8211; are prevented being sent to the server until the first request times out. He says he filed a bug with Apple and is communicating with the Safari team about this.</p>
<p>But it looks like another developer (spotted on <a target="_blank" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4552558">Hacker News</a>, of course) has a different explanation. He says it&#8217;s not a one connection per server thing, but rather an issue that occurs if the long polling connection starts before the page is fully loaded, and he offers a fix.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s weird is that this wasn&#8217;t spotted by Apple or the numerous developers using the iOS 6 beta builds beforehand, especially considering how many developers out there also offer web app (and specifically AJAX) versions of their native iOS applications. I&#8217;m sure this is something Apple will address, since it&#8217;s a problem affecting a bunch of the web apps we know and love. (Conspiracy theory: Apple broke web apps on purpose so you&#8217;ll download the native version! Ha ha ha! Kidding, of course.).</p>
<p>Me, I&#8217;m just happy to discover that it&#8217;s actually a real bug, and I&#8217;m not crazy for getting annoyed by it. Now someone, please fix this.</p>
