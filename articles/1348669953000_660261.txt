A leaked SDK of said build, however, has been floating around as of late and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wpcentral.com/windows-phone-8-os-walkthrough-finalized-emulator-and-sdk">WP Central</a> posted the following video of what it says is not a thorough walkthrough of the upcoming OS but covers &#8220;things we noticed immediately.&#8221;</p>

<p>At first glance, it doesn&#8217;t reveal anything that hasn&#8217;t already been seen, talked about or currently present in Windows Phone 7+ but as WPC points it, it could mean that Microsoft is keeping a few things under wraps until the OS is ready for launch. Or there isn&#8217;t anything else left to show. Which, if true, begs the question of why Microsoft is holding back the launch of Windows Phone 8 nearly a month after Apple&#8217;s latest handset and mobile OS will have launched.</p>
<p>It obviously has more to do with the launch of Windows 8 at the end of October but conventional wisdom would suggest that&#8217;s a bonehead move. </p>
