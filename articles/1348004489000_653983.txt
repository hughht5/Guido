Indoor Streetview) initiative in April 2010, but this indoor imagery was often hard to find and only appeared on Google+ Local and in the Google Search sidebar. On Google Maps, however, it was virtually impossible to find these panoramic indoor images. Starting today, however, Google will <a target="_blank" href="http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2012/09/an-easier-way-to-find-panoramic.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FSbSV+%28Google+LatLong%29">highlight indoor imagery</a> with a yellow circle whenever you drag the orange pegman onto a map.</p>

<p>These images, says Google, give you &#8220;the feeling of being there, and the comfort of knowing what to expect when you arrive.&#8221; One issue with this approach, though, is that it&#8217;s often hard to figure out what business you are actually looking at, as the name often doesn&#8217;t appear on the map or inside the Street View interface.</p>
<p>When Business Photos launch, Google only focused on a few countries, but it has since expanded the reach of this program. In a number of select cities the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, France, Ireland, Netherlands, Canada and the UK, businesses can now hire Google-approved photographers to take these 360-degree panoramic images for them. In addition, business owners can also <a target="_blank" href="http://googlesmb.blogspot.com/2012/01/welcome-customers-into-your-business-on.html">upload their own images</a> through Google+ Local.</p>
<p>In May, Google also <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/09/google-maps-for-android-gets-google-offers-business-photos-indoor-walking-directions/">started highlighting</a> these business photos in Google Maps on Android.</p>
