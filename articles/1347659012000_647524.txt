<p>We had the chance to catch up with entrepreneur and investor <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/kevin-rose">Kevin Rose</a> during TechCrunch Disrupt, asking him about a multitude of startup zeitgeist topics, including the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/kevin-rose-were-not-trying-to-lowball-companies-at-google-ventures/">Y Combinator versus Google Ventures kerfuffle</a> and what today&#8217;s high seed stage valuations mean for entrepreneurs. Rose held that high valuations sometimes turns off potential investors, and then brought up how he had passed on investing in Pinterest at a $5 million valuation, as an example.<br />

Paul Graham</a>&#8216;s <a target="_blank" href="http://uncrunched.com/2012/09/07/turning-the-drama-down-on-y-combinator-v-google-ventures/">warning</a> about Google Ventures undercutting existing valuation caps for seed rounds sent ripples throughout the tech and tech media gossip circles last week, but Rose held that it wasn&#8217;t common practice for Google Ventures to lowball startups.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a $200 million yearly fund, it really doesn&#8217;t move the needle one way or another if a company is an $8 million or a $10 million cap or a $12 million cap,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But for me personally, I&#8217;m not going to invest in something that is over valued.&#8221; Rose brought up the case of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bufferbox.com/">BufferBox,</a> where Google Ventures eventually accepted that startup&#8217;s valuation cap. (Rose <a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+KevinRose/posts/cGcxxmiV56W">referred</a> to Bufferbox and Clever as some of the best and brightest prospects in the current YC class).</p>
<p>Rose did however warn against the perils of overvaluations, &#8220;When you drive valuations up you&#8217;re getting rid of a lot of good investors.&#8221; He said that Pinterest CEO <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/ben-silbermann">Ben Silbermann</a>Â showed him the platform about three or four years ago, offering him an angel investment opportunity at a $5 million valuation. &#8220;At the time I thought, wow, that&#8217;s really high,&#8221; Rose said. He called Pinterest &#8220;the one that will forever have got away&#8221; and confirmed that the startup had seen &#8220;really decent traction&#8221; at that point.</p>
<p>In hindsight, a basic $25k investment in Pinterest at $5 million valuation would mean $7.5 million in value at its <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/17/rakuten-ceo-on-the-100b-pinterest-round-we-want-pinterest-users-to-pin-images-and-buy-using-our-id/">current $1.5 billion valuation,</a> a $50k investment would be now worth about $15 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;You go in there now and you see some of these companies that don&#8217;t have a fraction of the traction that Pinterest had at that time with valuations at three times as much,&#8221; Rose said, &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to figure out where we are in the bubble lifecycle and when is that going to correct itself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Or if some of those of &#8220;overvalued&#8221; companies are actually budding Pinterests.</p>
