Although there has been no official word concerning the DX, the product was reduced from $379 to $299 and the DX is currently out of stock on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-DX-Wireless-Reader-3G-Global/dp/B002GYWHSQ">Amazon</a>. </p>
<p>Amazon designed the 9.7-inch reader as a way to display full pages of content at once and allow readers to see images and text a bit more easily. Launched in 2009, the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2009/06/12/review-kindle-dx/">DX appeared just as readers</a> were thinking about the differences between tablets and e-readers and magazine and newspaper publishers were excited to drop print and move into the ereaders. You&#8217;ll recall this is the same period that Hearst media tried and failed to launch the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/01/09/can-the-skiff-save-the-magazine-industry/">color Skiff e-reader for magazines</a>.</p>
<p>The 6-inch form factor for e-readers seems like the way to go and while I don&#8217;t doubt Amazon will release a bigger reader at some point, it seems this heavy, hearty e-reader has gone the way of the great <i>Dinornis novaezelandiae</i> of New Zealand.</p>
