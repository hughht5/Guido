Well, today, it&#8217;s taking a big leap in that direction. The organization announced it&#8217;s bumping up the amount of funding its companies will receive. In addition to the $15,000 in seed funding the incubator provides, startups now also have the opportunity to receive a $100,000 convertible note.</p>
<p>The convertible notes are being drawn from a $6 million fund, which will cover the next 60 companies participating in the program &#8211; meaning, the next 6 classes of startups over the next 3 years. Money for the fund, which is currently half committed to, has been raised from a broad group of investors, including angels, VC&#8217;s, and even family funds, all of which are interested in supporting these types of startups, Greenstart co-founder Mitch Lowe tells us.</p>
<p>With the additional financing available, the hope is that Greenstart will be able to attract even more developers, he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;This allows the startups in the program to stay focused on customer and product development instead of hitting the streets for investors,&#8221; explains Lowe. &#8220;It should also help Greenstart attract interest from a much wider pool of innovative entrepreneurs for our upcoming programs.”</p>
<p>Previously, Greenstart offered $25,000 in seed funding, but lowered that to $15,000 now that the companies have the extra $100k option. They&#8217;ve also lowered the equity stake from 6 percent to 5 percent, we&#8217;re told.</p>
<p>Like other startup incubators, Greenstart provides <a href="http://greenstart.com/about/mentors">mentoring</a>, discounts, office space, etc., plus it also recently launched an in-house design practice, led by new COO <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/david-merkoski/2/934/900">David Merkoski</a>, the former Executive Creative Director of frog design. The design practice is meant to help participating companies with their UI and UX needs &#8211; something that&#8217;s often lacking in the cleantech space.</p>
<p>But the extra funding is the biggest news for this relatively new organization.</p>
<p>&#8220;$15,000 is Ramen money,&#8221; Lowe jokes. &#8220;With $115,000, you can really make some progress.&#8221;</p>
<p>Greenstart <a href="http://www.greenstart.com/apply">just opened up applications</a> to its Fall 2012 program today &#8211; the deadline for submission is April 11th.</p>
