<p>From a consumer perspective, the Taplister website and iOS app allows you to browse nearby bars to see what beers are available, or to search for a certain beer and see which bars are serving it. Businesses can claim their profiles, but even if not, they&#8217;re still in the system with data is crowdsourced from Taplister users.</p>
<p>And for bars and breweries, Taplister should provide a relatively easy way to update their menu via Web browser and give customers the most up-to-date information about what they&#8217;re serving. (That can be particularly important if you&#8217;re a small brewery without much of a marketing budget.) People can find that information in Taplister, but it can also be shared on Facebook and Twitter, and even through something that the company is calling a Digital Beer Board — a digital menu meant to be displayed in the store on an HDTV or 1080 pixel display.</p>
<p>Founder and CEO Kerry Finstand says he&#8217;s actually been working on a version of the service since 2009, but now he&#8217;s on Taplister full-time, and he&#8217;s ready to turn it from a side project into a real company. As part of the &#8220;launch&#8221;, he&#8217;s also announcing redesigned versions of the website and iPhone app, as well as integration with RateBeer (which can provide more information about the beers) and Foursquare.</p>

<p>But is there really a big market for this? (Other beer apps include <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/07/beer-app-untappd-hits-1m-checkins-swallows-up-other-beer-app-redpint/">&#8220;Foursquare for beer&#8221; Untappd</a>.) Especially if the app is focused specifically on craft beers? Well, Finstand points to Brewers Association data showing that craft beer surpassed 5 percent of the total amount of beer sold, while the volume of the total beer market declined by 1.32 percent — so he argues that the industry is on the rise. </p>
<p>Finstand also argues that you don&#8217;t have to be a hardcore beer expert to be interested in good beer. He points to his own evolution as a beer drinker, which led him from PBR to Blue Moon to things like Deschutes and Widmer, and now into barley. And he says there&#8217;s definitely user interest. Initially, he only wanted to expand Taplister into a city after a certain number of bars had signed up, but then he started to get more demands from users to open their location, and now it&#8217;s available in more than 50 cities.</p>
<p>Taplister is free for consumers, and pricing starts at $99 a month for businesses.</p>
