Google just <a target="_blank" href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/10/nexus-best-of-google-now-in-three-sizes.html">released the details</a> on a significant update that includes larger storage options for less money. Starting today, the Nexus 7 is available with 16GB for $199 and 32GB for $249. There is also a $299 32GB 3G model, providing Google plenty of ammo to fight off Apple and its new iPad mini.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s news was supposed to be announced at a large NYC event. But <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/27/raincheck-google-cancels-nyc-android-event-planned-for-monday-due-to-hurricane-sandy/">Hurricane Sandy decided to come to town</a>. Google instead announced the Nexus 7 updates along with <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/29/lg-nexus-4-android-smartphone/">Nexus 4</a>, Nexus 10, and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/29/android-4-2-jelly-bean/">Android 4.2</a> on its Android blog.</p>
<p>The Nexus 7 update does not bring any physical changes to the 7-inch tablet. It&#8217;s still the same Asus-made device as before &#8212; just a little cheaper. The new 3G model operates on HSPA+ GSM networks (AT&amp;T in the US).</p>
<p>Google also announced the latest version of Android today, which will hit the Nexus 7 shortly. Still designated Jelly Bean, Android 4.2 features multiple user accounts, a revamped camera interface, and quick settings. Android 4.2 also brings Photo Sphere panoramic camera, gesture typing, and wireless HDTV streaming, making up for the N7&#8242;s lack of HDMI port &#8212; but it&#8217;s unclear at this point if the N7 will get these features.</p>
<p>The new 3G 32GB model will be available on November 13. Look for it in the Google Play Store in the U.S., U.K., Australia, France, Germany, Spain and Canada. The 16GB and 32GB WiFi-only model hits standard retail partners shortly.</p>
<p>So, for those keeping track, the 3G 32GB Nexus 7 is available for $30 less than the WiFi-only 16GB iPad mini and a whooping $260 less than the 4G 32GB iPad mini. Just saying.</p>
