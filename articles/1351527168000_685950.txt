Google just released the details on a significant update that includes larger storage options for less money. Starting today, the Nexus 7 is available with 16GB for $199 and 32GB for $249. There is also a $299 3G modelproviding Google plenty of ammo to fight off Apple and its new iPad mini.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s news was supposed to be announced at a large NYC event. But <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/27/raincheck-google-cancels-nyc-android-event-planned-for-monday-due-to-hurricane-sandy/">Hurricane Sandy decided to come to town</a>. Google instead announced the Nexus 7 updates along with <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/29/lg-nexus-4-android-smartphone/">Nexus 4</a>, Nexus 10, and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/29/android-4-2-jelly-bean/">Android 4.2</a> on its Android blog.</p>
<p>The Nexus 7 update does not bring any physical changes to the 7-inch tablet. It&#8217;s still the same Asus-made device as before &#8212; just a little cheaper.</p>
<p>Google also announced the latest version of Android today, which will hit the Nexus 7 shortly. Still designated Jelly Bean, Android 4.2 features multiple user accounts, a revamped camera interface, and quick settings.</p>
