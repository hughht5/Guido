It has launched a new service in the UK called <a target="_blank" href="http://secretguru.co.uk/">Secretguru</a>&#8211; a concierge-style service where people can buy time from professionals in areas ranging from cooking to business mentoring and beauty. The move puts eBay into the territory of collaborative consumption services like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.taskrabbit.com">TaskRabbit</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zaarly.com">Zaarly</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.care.com">Care.com</a>, and it is a sign of how it&#8217;s looking to extend its operations into brands beyond that of eBay itself.</p>
<p>For now, eBay is calling this a pilot still in beta, and it is running it only in the UK. &#8220;Since it is a very early pilot (beta), you might notice some things that need improving,&#8221; it says on the About page. &#8220;We are eager to hear about you and know what you liked and did not like. So please get in touch.&#8221; We have contacted eBay to ask what plans it has to roll it out further.</p>
<p>Just as eBay itself has become a well-known and well-used marketplace for people selling physical goods, Secretguru is extending that idea into hiring people. &#8220;Gurus&#8221; get their own pages on the site &#8212; for now all very uniform and templated &#8212; where they can describe what they do and why they are the best people for a particular job. Those interested in hiring them make contact through the site to ask further questions or negotiate a rate and assignment.</p>
<p>The focus, at least for now, appears to be on a curated list of professional people rather than creating a listing of thousands who can offer services for a job for the lowest rate possible. People are listed by expertise, not price, for starters, and given the sorts of services on offer, the implication is that price is perhaps not the first consideration for would-be customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;SecretGuru is a service that puts you in touch with experts (or Gurus) you can hire to create new, fun &amp; memorable experiences. These people can be hard to find, so we set up SecretGuru so you can spend more time enjoying what they have to offer!&#8221; the site reads. &#8220;Our Gurus span a variety of industries, so you’ll find professional chefs you can hire to cook at your dinner party, artists who&#8217;ll paint a bespoke mural in your home, and even shoe designers who&#8217;ll teach you how to make your own shoes!&#8221;</p>
<p>There doesn&#8217;t appear to be a way of users reviewing people yet, but that may come as the service matures.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We&#8217;re reaching out to eBay for further details on Secretguru and will update this story as we learn more.</p>
