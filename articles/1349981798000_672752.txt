That&#8217;s a Thursday. </p>
<p>At the beginning of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/05/live-from-motorolas-on-display-android-press-conference/">September</a>, Motorola took the stage announcing the first phones completely under the helm of Google. Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt even made a little speech. We met the Droid Razr HD, Droid Razr Maxx HD, and the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/05/motorola-droid-razr-m-official/">Razr M</a>. </p>
<p>The Razr M launched that day, but the other two flagships were given a vague availability date. Naturally, the M enjoyed much of the hype post-event. But Verizon has finally given us a date, not too long from now either, to mark down on our calendars. </p>
<p>The Razr HD will cost $199.99 on-contract, while the Razr Maxx HD, with an upgraded battery, will cost $299.99 with contract. The Razr HD comes in black and white, with 16GB of storage, while the Razr Maxx HD is only available in the 32GB black model. </p>
<p>The phones run on Verizon&#8217;s 4G LTE network, and boast 4.7-inch display, NFC and that now well-known iconic Kevlar fiber back casing. The phones all ship with Ice Cream Sandwich, but an upgrade to Jelly Bean has been promised to potential buyers. </p>
