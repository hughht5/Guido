If CNN&#8217;s public &#8220;news pulse&#8221; is any indication, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/apple-iphone-5-official/">iPhone 5</a> news was more than <em>twice</em> as popular as an international crisis that has our Commander-in-Chief sending two Navy destroyers armed with Tomahawk missiles off the coast of Libya. &#8220;It is a sad, sad commentary on our nation when #apple is trending higher than #libya,&#8221; <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/JessicaScott09/status/245960188610351104">tweeted</a> army officer and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pbs.org/pov/regardingwar/author/jessica-scott/">author</a> Jessica Scott.</p>

Senator Ron Wyden, an early opponent of the Stop Online Piracy Act, has put a hold on a matching bill in the Senate against the wishes of President Obama.</p>

<p>So, we might be embroiled in another foreign conflict without 4th amendment privacy protections. But, hey, the new iPhone has a 4-inch screen. Oh, the iPhone also works over the blazing-fast LTE network. Wait&#8230;what country were we talking about again?</p>
