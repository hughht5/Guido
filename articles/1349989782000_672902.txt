Twitter user @AnonymousOwn3r is claiming responsibility, as he had done in the past for a <a title="GoDaddy Says Crash Wasn’t Anonymous, It Wasn’t A Hack, It Wasn’t A DDoS. It Was Internal Network Issues" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/godaddy-says-it-wasnt-anonymous-it-wasnt-a-hack-it-wasnt-a-ddos-it-was-internal-network-issues/">major GoDaddy outage as well</a>. Later, GoDaddy claimed that a technical problem on its own end was responsible, not any hacking attack, however, and the cause of this current European outage is still unknown.</p>
<p>In the case of the GoDaddy outage, that company claimed that the DNS problems that brought down thousands of its websites was actually caused by &#8220;a series of internal network events that corrupted router data tables,&#8221; and not Anonymous Own3r, as had been originally claimed by that individual&#8217;s Twitter account toward the beginning of the outage.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re looking into the cause of Facebook&#8217;s downtime (DNS issues are being cited by some), and have reached out to Facebook to find out more. Let us know if you&#8217;re in Europe and whether or not you&#8217;re able to access the social network, we&#8217;ll keep updating as we learn more.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> A user in France reports that simply switching to Facebook&#8217;s mobile site can restore service for those affected:</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> It&#8217;s unclear how wide-reaching this is – some claims now that it&#8217;s only affecting a small percentage of European users:</p>
