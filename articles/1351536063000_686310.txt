As the name implies, the Chrome Remote Desktop app <a target="_blank" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-remote-desktop/gbchcmhmhahfdphkhkmpfmihenigjmpp">runs in Chrome</a> and allows you to share your desktop with others or control theirs to see presentations or, as Google notes, become the family hero by &#8220;adjusting printer settings on your mom’s computer to finding a lost file on your dad’s laptop.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to taking the service out of beta, Google also added a few new features to the tool. Most interestingly, Windows users can now share a real-time audio feed using the tool. This new version also brings the ability to copy-and-paste between your local machine and the remote computer you control. Google promises that it will continue to work on the Chrome Remote Desktop service and make it &#8220;even more powerful&#8221; in the future.</p>

<p>While the service runs in Chrome, you actually have to download and install a helper app to get things to work. The install process of the Chrome app will automatically prompt you to download these applications, which run on Windows, Mac and Linux.</p>
<p>Once installed, using the tools is about as easy as using applications like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.teamviewer.com/en/index.aspx">TeamViewer</a> and other comparable services. If you want to share your own screen, you get a code to give to your family member or colleague to initiate the connection. In our brief tests, the image quality was quite good and comparable to similar services.</p>
