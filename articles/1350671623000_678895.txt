Instead of just showing you a list of related items that other people also searched for, hovering over these icons now shows you how they are related to your search query.</p>
<p>Currently, Google says, this works for actors, movies and TV shows, as well as &#8220;family connections amongst famous people in the Knowledge Graph.&#8221; In Google&#8217;s example &#8211; a search for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gone+with+the+wind">Gone With The Wind</a> &#8211; the explanations in the &#8220;People also search for&#8221; section highlights the fact that the movie&#8217;s director also directed some of the other movies others searched for. Google notes that it won&#8217;t show this information for every search, but only &#8221; when there is an interesting explanation available, you can now see it at a glance just by mousing over or clicking.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/19/google-knowledge-graph-panels-explanations/gone-with-wind-expanded5-1/" rel="attachment wp-att-678899"></a>This is obviously just a minor update, but it does highlight the kind of information Google can zero in on thanks to its <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/16/google-just-got-a-whole-lot-smarter-launches-its-knowledge-graph/">Knowledge Graph project</a>. This project, which brings a wealth of semantic knowledge to Google Search, will likely touch the majority of Google&#8217;s search products over time.</p>
<p>Just recently, for example, Google used this information to power <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/13/google-drops-some-knowledge-graph-on-kevin-bacon/">its Bacon Number calculator</a> and started highlighting the Knowledge Graph boxes even more prominently by moving the results to the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/05/google-to-start-displaying-knowledge-graph-carousel-to-users-globally/">top of the screen</a> for some searches.</p>
