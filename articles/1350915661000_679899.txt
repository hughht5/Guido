<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/soundtracking.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="soundtracking" title="soundtracking" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Today, the relationship between social music startup <a target="_blank" href="http://www.soundtracking.com">SoundTracking</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.spotify.com">Spotify</a> became a little more harmonious: the startup from Schematic Labs is the latest to launch an <a target="_blank" href="http://open.spotify.com/app/soundtracking">app for Spotify</a>, making it the latest platform where users can create and then share their musical &#8220;postcards&#8221; with their freinds. Schematic are using the occasion to launch a couple of other cool features: Instagram integration and the ability to create playlists, to capitalize on the fact that SoundTracking now has 10 million daily &#8220;music moments&#8221; shared on its network via Facebook, Twitter and Foursquare.</p>
<p>The news is the latest development of a relationship between SoundTracking and Spotify that first started last year, when SoundTracking released an <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/06/soundtrackings-new-android-app-has-spotify-and-rdio-integration-so-yes-you-can-listen-to-full-songs/">Android app</a> that became the first instance of users being able to link to full-track versions of songs rather than short clips. It is also a sign of how SoundTracking is becoming a richer platform in its own right, a new kind of light, special-interest-focused social network. &#8220;What we have designed and built is a social network for music, not in the form of a large website and links but something very simple,&#8221; says CEO Steve Jang. &#8220;We focus on two high level interactions for sharing: viewing and listening.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Instagram integration is fitting for a company that has been described by some as the &#8220;Instagram of music sharing.&#8221; Jang says that while people have been using their own pictures in their postcards on the service, this is also about leaning on a popular service that has become for many the default photo app on their phones, and one that has been conducive to people interacting with each other. It is also a way of formalizing something people had already been doing informally: &#8220;People had been hacking their way into putting Instagram photos on to their SoundTracking posts,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It took three onerous steps to do it. Now it won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rather frustratingly, the Instagram feature is for now only available on the Spotify app. Jang says it&#8217;s looking first at Spotify &#8220;to see what happens&#8221; before turning to its iOS and Android apps.</p>
<p>But while Instagram photos can be imported into SoundTracking, Jang says that SoundTracking tags are not going to appear back on those photos in their original location on Instagram&#8217;s network. That is something they are considering, however, he tells me.</p>
<p>Both are a sign of how SoundTracking is continuing to grow up and become a more full-service music sharing app, or, in the words of Jang, to offer &#8220;a rich contextual way to mix audio and visual elements in a more personal and emotional way.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the Spotify integration, this gives the streaming service one more way for people to discover music and spend time on the platform &#8212; two key focus areas for Spotify as it continues to build out its company as a platform in its own right for music services. Jang says that development was also in response to feedback from SoundTracking&#8217;s own community of users, who were already on Spotify and wanted to see closer linking of the two.</p>
<p>And given that SoundTracking is a mobile-first service, linking it up with Spotify could be seen in another light: it could be a sign of how SoundTracking is trying to make further moves into music consumption on desktop devices. (Indeed, Jang says that Schematic is also looking at developing a Mac desktop app for SoundTracking.)</p>
<p>But it could also could point to what Spotify hopes to do on mobile: it already has a lot of users of its mobile app, and we have also seen signs pointing to Spotify looking to extend its <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/09/is-spotify-preparing-to-push-its-app-center-to-its-ios-mobile-app/">App Center to mobile</a>, too.</p>
<p>Since SoundTracking launched last year &#8212; the last user number the company revealed was 1 million users when it announced funding of $4.75 million in November 2011, but has not updated that number since &#8212; Jang says that it has picked up a user base that is 60% U.S., with the rest coming from the rest of the world with an emphasis on Japan, the UK, Brazil and Mexico.</p>
<p>As for looking at other platforms like Windows, this may not be coming soon. &#8220;It’s hard for a company of our size to take on a new code base,&#8221; says Jang. &#8220;With our web site, Android, iOS and Spotify, we already have four. That’s already maxing it out.&#8221;</p>
