They&#8217;re called &#8220;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/16/beats-by-dre-pill-speaker/">Beats By Dre</a>&#8221; and until now, they were made in concert with the company Monster. Apparently that has changed now and Beats are its own thing now, and that&#8217;s good. I&#8217;m not a fan of Monster products, but that&#8217;s a story for another day.</p>
<p>I went on a bit of a tirade on Twitter about how Beats were replacing your old overpriced pieces of crap with new overpriced pieces of crap, so the company reached out to me and asked if I&#8217;d check them out and review them. I obliged.</p>
<p>The pair that the company sent me are called the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.beatsbydre.com/headphones/beats-executive/900-00047-01,default,pd.html">&#8220;Executive&#8221; model</a>, and I think it&#8217;s a marketing ploy to get the attention of people who travel a lot who might make a bagload of money every year. That&#8217;s so not me, so it&#8217;s weird that I&#8217;m reviewing them. However, I am obsessed with music, so perhaps my thoughts will shed some light on whether these $299.95 headphones are indeed a piece of crap &#8211; or are worth buying.</p>
<p>Before I start, here&#8217;s the official marketing description of these things:</p>
<blockquote><p>Beats Executive™ headphones are designed to take you from boardroom to the tarmac and everywhere in between. These headphones deliver the legendary Beats sound now in a refined premium package that&#8217;s easier than ever to take on the road.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ok, let&#8217;s get going.</p>
<h3>How they look</h3>
<p>Not going to lie, these things are gorgeous. That&#8217;s the whole Beats by Dre &#8220;thing&#8221; though, style over substance for the most part. Are most of the headphones made by the company pieces of crap for real? No, but they&#8217;re not much better than a brand like, say, Bose. </p>
<p>The Executive model is grey, has the Beats logo on the side and look pretty comfortable. That&#8217;s good, because they are comfortable. They&#8217;re honestly the most comfortable over-ear headphones I&#8217;ve ever put on. I can&#8217;t use the new Apple Ear Pad/Bud/Whatevers because they don&#8217;t fit into my ear properly. Oh well. They&#8217;re also really light, which I wouldn&#8217;t have guessed.</p>
<p>The cord is red, which is also something that is unique to Beats, and I wish it would have shipped with a more understated black or grey color. Having said that, it&#8217;s extremely good quality and it shows.  Well done.</p>

<p>Anyone can tell you if something is pretty or not, so let&#8217;s get to how they perform.</p>
<h3>How they perform</h3>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/26/heres-the-beats-by-dre-executive-headphone-review-by-someone-who-actually-used-them/4a26195e1c9511e288f622000a1de761_7/" rel="attachment wp-att-684775"></a>Forget about price, let&#8217;s just think about pure performance. I had our own Josh Constine put them on during a train ride, and I have to say that the noise cancellation did the job. However, the headphones seem to miss the extreme &#8220;highs&#8221; and &#8220;lows.&#8221; If you&#8217;re looking for a sound with deep deep bass, don&#8217;t get the Executive model, you&#8217;ll be really disappointed. </p>
<p>Having said that, the sound is really crisp and there&#8217;s no crackling or interference from the noise cancellation at all. I haven&#8217;t used them on an actual plane yet, but I felt that the train test was close enough to share my thoughts.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve used them with my iPhone, Nexus 7 and my laptop, and the sound is consistent over all devices. Clearly, the sounds coming out of my MacBook pro are superior, but that&#8217;s only because I was not listening to heavily compressed or streaming music. </p>
<h3>Things that are missing</h3>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/26/heres-the-beats-by-dre-executive-headphone-review-by-someone-who-actually-used-them/photo-4-19/" rel="attachment wp-att-684776"></a>There&#8217;s one thing that drives me nuts about these headphones, and it&#8217;s the fact that the on/off switch that powers them doesn&#8217;t automatically shut down when they&#8217;re folded up and not being used. The Executive headphones take two double-a batteries, and I&#8217;ve gone through four of them in the past four days because I have forgotten to turn them off.</p>
<p>For almost three hundred bucks, I expect better. Maybe all headphones are like this and I&#8217;m just absent-minded, but man does this make me want to toss these things out of that moving train.</p>
<p>Other than missing the highs and lows, I really wish that the headphones had some sort of microphone on them too. Since I&#8217;m an &#8220;executive&#8221;, I use the phone a lot. It&#8217;s a real pain in the ass to be listening to Spotify when a call comes in and forget that there&#8217;s no mic on my headphones. Duh. </p>
<h3>Good job, good effort</h3>
<p>As promised, I shared my review and was completely honest. Would I buy these headphones with my own money? Probably not, because I&#8217;m not the target audience. If you really do fly a lot and you want to show off the fact that you&#8217;re someone high-up at a company, the Executive headphones by Dre are worth picking up. For the rest of us, $300 is a lot to throw down.</p>
<p>Remember, these headphones only come in silver&#8230;so you can&#8217;t even choose your style. </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re an audiophile, you could probably pick these things apart more than I ever could. Having said that, I&#8217;ve been consistently using them and enjoying how comfortable they are on my headpiece, even on top of my hats. Sounds stupid, but these things are important to me.</p>
<p>When I take them off, my ears aren&#8217;t sore, which I&#8217;ve experienced with expensive headphones from Bose in the past. </p>
<p>Buy or not to buy&#8230;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.beatsbydre.com/headphones/beats-executive/900-00047-01,default,pd.html">that&#8217;s up to you</a>. See you on the private jet, Execs.</p>
