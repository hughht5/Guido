<p>The iPhone-maker also announced that demand for the iPhone 5 far exceeded the initial supply, which is likely the only reason why opening weekend sales didn&#8217;t cross into the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/18/analyst-estimates-on-iphone-5-launch-weekend-sales-range-from-3m-10m/" title="Analyst Estimates On iPhone 5 Launch Weekend Sales Range From 3M-10M">6- to 10 million range some were predicting</a>.</p>
<p>Apple also announced that 100 million iOS devices have been updated to iOS 6, an amazing rate of adoption, considering that the company has sold <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/apple-has-sold-over-400-million-ios-devices-9-5-growth-since-march/" title="Apple Has Sold Over 400 Million iOS Devices: 9.5% Growth Since March">just north of 400 million</a>, according to its own numbers released earlier this month. We saw a lot of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/21/apple-users-adopting-ios-6-122-faster-than-ios-5-after-two-days/" title="Apple Users Adopting iOS 6 122% Faster Than iOS 5 After Two Days">evidence that adoption was very high</a>, very early on after the release of iOS 6, but Apple&#8217;s official totals really drive home just how many eagerly pushed that update button in the first week.</p>
