Today, two years later, CloudFlare CEO and co-founder Matthew Prince took the stage again at Disrupt to give the crowd a status update.</p>
<p>Prince said that at Disrupt 2010, the judges had been concerned about whether or not the startup would be able to scale effectively &#8212; something that can be hard to demonstrate in a demo at a startup pitch competition. In spite of the early skepticism, CloudFlare has been able to hit scale pretty quickly. Prince said that CloudFlare is today providing security and speedy rendering for half a trillion pageviews &#8212; not an insignificant number.</p>
