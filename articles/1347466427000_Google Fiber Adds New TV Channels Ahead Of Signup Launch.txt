Today, just ahead of the start of the sign-up process, Google <a target="_blank" href="http://googlefiberblog.blogspot.com/2012/09/update-on-google-fiber-tv-channel-lineup.html">announced</a> a few additions to its TV channel lineup. As Google notes, Google Fiber already offers almost 200 channels and, because the TV service is running over the gigabit network, it can not just offer all of its HD channels without extra charge, but also doesn&#8217;t need to compress its HD signal as heavily as other providers.</p>
<p>Here are all the additional new channels: ABC Family, ABC News Now, Disney Channel, Disney Junior, Disney XD, ESPN, ESPN Buzzer Beater, ESPN Classic, ESPN Deportes, ESPN Goal Line, ESPN2, ESPNews, ESPNU, Longhorn Network, Ovation, SOAPnet, TBN, TBN Enlace, Velocity.</p>
<p>Households in qualifying neighborhoods can sign up for the bundled Internet + TV service for <a target="_blank" href="http://fiber.google.com/plans/residential/">$120 per month</a> or just sign up for the Internet service for $70 per month. There is also a free option (though users will have to pay the $300 construction fee that&#8217;s currently waived for the other tiers). Users who sign up for the TV service will also get a free Nexus 7 tablet, as well as Google&#8217;s TV set-top boxes.</p>
<p>The Google Fiber sign-up process ended on Sunday night and 180 out of the 202 Kansas City, MO and KS neighborhoods reached their pre-registration goals. Until now, though, potential subscribers only had to put down $10 to pre-register. Now, users will have to decide if they actually want to pay for the service. For the &#8216;fiberhoods&#8217; that didn&#8217;t make it, Google will likely hold a second pre-registration rally at a later time, but the company hasn&#8217;t made any announcements about this yet.</p>
