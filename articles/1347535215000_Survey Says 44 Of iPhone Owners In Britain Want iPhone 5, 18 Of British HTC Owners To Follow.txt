That&#8217;s probably good news if you&#8217;re Cupertino-inclined. But for some of Apple&#8217;s competitors, bad news could be on the horizon.</p>
<p>According to the poll, 18% of current HTC smartphone owners in Britain want an iPhone too, while Nokia fared even worse with 20% of owners displaying iPhone 5 lust.</p>
<p>Overall, 20% of all smartphone owners said that they wanted to upgrade to the new iPhone without needing any further information about the product. Clearly, the iPhone&#8217;s <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/13/the-iphone-5-event/">magic trick</a> is still resonating with some this side of the pond.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Conducted by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.usurv.com/">Usurv</a>, which rather conveniently offers a self-serve online survey platform for exactly this type of quick fire research, the sample size of the poll was limited to 1,000 participants, so the results are pretty heavily extrapolated but quite telling nonetheless.</p>
<p>Amongst Apple&#8217;s competitors, there was better news for bitter rival Samsung. Owners of its Galaxy smartphones in Britain appear to be the most loyal of the bunch, with only 5% saying they want to switch to the iPhone 5.</p>
<p>Driving the iPhone 5 lust is, unsurprisingly, it&#8217;s larger screen, highlighted as the most appealing by 19% of respondents. In second place, the higher speed Internet access, making use of the new LTE network which is being <a title="UK’s First 4G LTE Service, EE, Will Feature New Nokia, Samsung, HTC, Huawei Devices.

Interestingly, however, 39% of those surveyed said that none of the new features appeal to them, and 27% thought that the iPhone 5 had been over-hyped without anything exciting or innovative.</p>
<p>Maybe the iPhone does need a new trick after all.</p>
