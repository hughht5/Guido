With Solidify, users can create these prototypes by linking together their existing sketches, wireframes or mockups. That&#8217;s just the first step, though. The real focus of Solidify is on testing these interfaces with real users at any phase of development.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/?attachment_id=674805" rel="attachment wp-att-674805"></a>This, says ZURB, will help users make user testing a more integral part of their design process. Traditional user testing, the company argues, is often time-consuming and disorganized. Instead of trying to organize focus groups or holding meetings to figure out untested details of a new product, Solidify can help its users get structured feedback for how real users interact with their ideas.</p>
<p>As these clickable prototypes are based on mockups, there is no limit to which screen sizes you can test with the service. Testers can also try your prototypes on mobile devices.</p>
<p>Designers can send their prototypes to ZURB&#8217;s network of testers or select their own. The product comes with an in-depth analytics tool that will allow designers to spot problems with their interactive designs early on. Here is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.solidifyapp.com/p/p9eb108cca47028d7">an example</a> of what these tests can look like.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that ZURB does not offer its own mockup tool, but it can obviously import image files from third-party tools like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a>. As it works with all popular image formats, you can also just take images of your own hand-drawn sketches and work with those.</p>
<p>ZURB offers a limited <a target="_blank" href="https://www.solidifyapp.com/account/new?plan=free">free plan</a> to test the app. There is also a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.solidifyapp.com/plans">basic paid version</a> ($19/month), which allows for unlimited prototyping and includes mobile testing and unlimited results. There is also a more fully featured version for $49/month that gives users the ability to get demographics reports and custom PDF reports, as well as the ability to customize their logo.</p>
