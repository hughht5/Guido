Both sites are targeting families with children, the former featuring over 70,000 items for &#8220;children&#8217;s activities&#8221; and the latter offering 45,000 children&#8217;s books to start.</p>
<p>According to the news provided to <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2012/10/17/amazon-sets-sites-on-kids">The WSJ</a>, both websites will go live on Thursday. For what it&#8217;s worth, AfterSchool.com&#8217;s homepage states that there are 50,000 products, &#8220;from baseball bats and soccer balls to ballet slippers and art supplies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Quidsi, though Amazon-owned, operates separately from its parent site, and offers easy-to-remember URLs that lead to narrow niches. The company launched with Diapers.com, which then became <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/20/diapers-com-on-its-way-to-selling-half-a-billion-diapers-raises-20-million-debt-round/">the biggest seller of diapers</a> online. It has since expanded into drugstore items with Soap.com, pet supplies with Wag.com, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/20/after-pets-diapers-and-soap-amazons-quidsi-tackles-toys-with-retail-site-yoyo/">toys with YoYo.com</a>, beauty care with BeautyBar.com, and more.</p>
<p>Amazon bought Quidsi <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/08/confirmed-amazon-spends-545-million-on-diapers-com-parent-quidsi/">in November 2010</a> for north of $500 million, and it continues to operate independently from its corporate parent. It doesn&#8217;t offer the benefit of Amazon Prime free shipping, for example, but it does offer free two-day shipping on order over $49, or $39 if buying items from two or more of its websites. First-time shoppers can also take 30% off on their first item purchased.</p>
<p>The WSJ also points out that, because of Quidsi&#8217;s independence (it even has its own warehouses), its prices will not always be in line with what Amazon offers &#8211; in some cases, items cost more, at other times, less. The same holds true for the new kids&#8217; verticals, they found.</p>
<p>Quidsi is also running a same-day shipping experiment, now only in New York City, though other U.S. cities may follow soon.</p>
