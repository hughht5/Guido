<p>Costolo&#8217;s response? First, he said he didn&#8217;t want to be &#8220;flip,&#8221;. Then he said, flippantly, &#8220;It&#8217;s become a little bit of, &#8216;I didn&#8217;t get my homework done because Twitter changed their API.&#8217;&#8221; In fact, he said the changes at IFTTT had &#8220;absolutely nothing to do with any changes of our API.&#8221;</p>
<p>We went into these issues in an earlier post, where wrote that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/20/ifttt-has-actually-been-in-violation-of-twitters-api-for-months-todays-move-unrelated-to-1-1/">IFTTT appears to have been in violation of Twitter&#8217;s API for months</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond the specific details of the IFTTT situation, Costolo was also asked if Twitter&#8217;s API changes are part of a general trend away from online openness. On the big issue, Costolo said he disagreed, and that people are always making generalizations like this based on &#8220;too few data points.&#8221; On the question of Twitter&#8217;s openness, he said, &#8220;We continue to spend an extraordinary amount of money providing a free API&#8221; that&#8217;s being accessed at &#8220;a ridiculous rate of queries per second.&#8221; As Twitter continues to build out its platform, it will do so in an open way, he added.</p>
<p>As for whether Twitter could have done a better job communicating the  API changes, Costolo said, &#8221;If there are people who think we&#8217;ve done a bad job of communicating these changes and why we&#8217;ve made them, then it doesn&#8217;t matter whether I think we&#8217;ve done a good job.&#8221; In other words, if people think Twitter has done a bad job communicating, then it has probably done a bad job communicating.</p>
<p>At the same time, he pushed back against some of the criticism, including <a target="_blank" href="http://dashes.com/anil/2012/08/what-twitters-api-announcement-could-have-said.html">Anil Dash&#8217;s attempt to lay out how Twitter&#8217;s announcement should have been worded</a>. Costolo said that Twitter did reach out to a number of developers for feedback ahead of the announcement, and Dash&#8217;s &#8220;rewritten post doesn&#8217;t communicate a bunch of things that developers said they cared about.&#8221; Costolo argued that &#8220;these things are always more complex than they sound&#8221; and he doesn&#8217;t intend to throw someone &#8220;under the bus&#8221; because the blog post was controversial.</p>
<p>We have another post covering <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/21/you-might-be-able-to-download-all-your-tweets-by-end-of-the-year/">Costolo&#8217;s comments on adding the ability for users to download all their tweets</a>.</p>
