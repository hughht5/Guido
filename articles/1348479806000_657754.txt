<p>Galaxy S III owners in Poland are first in the queue for the Jelly Bean update which began rolling out there today. Samsung confirmed the update in a statement, adding that it will be &#8220;gradually introduced to other markets&#8221; &#8212; with no further details on specific markets and timeframes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The availability and schedule of the software upgrade will vary by market and wireless carriers’ requirements,&#8221; the statement adds &#8212; a stock warning to expect some carrier foot-dragging.  The Google-branded Samsung Galaxy Nexus and the Nexus S were due Jelly Bean updates in mid-July, along with the Motorola Xoom and Nexus 7 tablets &#8212; although that mid-July timeframe hasn&#8217;t always been stuck to. For instance <a target="_blank" href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/21/verizon-galaxy-nexus-finally-lands-jelly-bean-update/">Engadget</a> just reported it took until two days ago for the Verizon-branded Galaxy Nexus to finally get its payload of Jelly Beans.</p>
<p>The Android 4.1 update brings a raft of improvements and new features to the S III, including real-time reminders and recommendations from <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/27/google-now/">Google Now</a>, plus speed and responsiveness boosts thanks to OS additions such as triple buffering in the graphics pipeline, and enforced consistent frame-rate for all drawing and animations. Android 4.1 also makes educated guesses about where your fingers are heading as you swipe and flick the screen to improve responsiveness.</p>
<p>In addition to the changes wrought by Android 4.1, Samsung is updating some of its software on the S III &#8212; including adding the ability to resize the Pop Up Play video window. Here&#8217;s the full list of new Samsung software features:</p>
<ul>
<li>With the Easy Mode, users can find 5 large Easy widgets on the home screen which allow quick and easy access to the frequently used applications. The Easy widgets include both 4&#215;2 and 4&#215;4 arrangements of Favorite contacts, Favorite apps, Favorite settings, and Clock and Alarm.</li>
<li>Blocking Mode adds extra convenience, enabling users to block incoming calls, notifications, alarms and LED indicators for a designated period of time.</li>
<li>A pause function is added to the camera, so users can record a continuous video while only capturing the moments they want; just like on a video camera, the recording can easily be stopped and resumed.</li>
<li>Users now can place the upgraded ‘Pop up play’ to watch a video anywhere on the phone’s screen while running other apps, and can change the size of the player window.</li>
</ul>
<p>Samsung is already lining up a new Android 4.1 device coming to Europe in October, and the U.S. in November &#8212; the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/29/samsung-note-2/">Galaxy Note II</a> &#8212; so it makes sense for the company to get Jelly Bean onto its other flagship handset, the S III, without serious delay. The Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) update to Samsung&#8217;s 2011 flagship phone, the Galaxy S II, took months to arrive so it&#8217;s also likely Samsung is keen for the update process to run more smoothly this time around.</p>
<p>Samsung also confirmed Jelly Bean will be coming to additional devices &#8220;soon&#8221; &#8212; here&#8217;s the full list:</p>
<blockquote><p>Following soon will be Jelly Bean upgrades for GALAXY Tab 2 7.0 &amp; 10.1, GALAXY Note 10.1, GALAXY SII, GALAXY Note, GALAXY Tab 7.0 Plus, GALAXY S Advance, GALAXY SII LTE, GALAXY Music, GALAXY Chat, GALAXY Ace 2, GALAXY Beam, GALAXY Ace Plus, GALAXY mini II and GALAXY S DUOS.</p></blockquote>
