Docomo will also establish an operating company to manage the fund by then, which it&#8217;s planning to distribute over a 10 year period.</p>
<p>The aim of the fund and incubator is to accelerate the creation of new business models, services and technologies with &#8220;the potential to be developed as all-new or upgraded offerings from parent Docomo&#8221;. The carrier is targeting eight strategic fields &#8212; namely: Media/Content, Finance/Payment, Commerce, Medical/Healthcare, Machine-to-Machine (M2M), Aggregation/Platforms, Environment/Ecology, and Security/Safety.</p>
<p>The fund will invest primarily in Japanese startups and venture companies, some of which Docomo expects to come from the incubator program. The program will offer resources and know-how, including office space, business infrastructure, and networking and expertise events to support and nurture participating startups. Four or five teams of startups will gain three to four months of support per program.</p>
<p>Docomo already conducts startup investments in the U.S. via its subsidiary, Docomo Innovations &#8212; and plans to continue doing so.</p>
