That&#8217;s up from <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/13/page-google-plus-40-million-mobile-2-5-billion/">$2.5 billion</a> a year ago. The company&#8217;s mobile ad revenue has more than tripled over the past year.</p>
<p>But Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for Google, says that the new run rate for this quarter includes more than just mobile ad revenue. Now, the new mobile run rate includes revenue from sales of Google Play mobile content and gross revenue from spending on Play apps. </p>
