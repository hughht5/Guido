<p>When T-Mobile announced it would carry the<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/08/t-mobile-will-launch-lgs-ice-cream-sandwich-powered-optimus-l9-this-fall/"> LG Optimus L9</a> earlier today, I bemoaned the carrier&#8217;s lack of compelling exclusive devices. As it turns out, that may have been a bit hasty of me &#8212; Nokia has <a target="_blank" href="http://conversations.nokia.com/2012/10/08/nokia-lumia-810-comes-to-t-mobile-usa/">just let slip</a> that its new Windows Phone 8-powered Lumia 810 will hit T-Mobile&#8217;s shelves in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>As the name implies, the Lumia 810 is a mildly-tweaked version of the Lumia 820 that rival carrier AT&amp;T will carry later this year. Most of the device&#8217;s basics remain the same &#8212; it still sports a 4.3-inch OLED Clear Black display (running at WVGA, for better or worse), Nokia&#8217;s slew of software additions, and an 8-megapixel rear-facing camera &#8212; but the 810 is obviously tuned to play nice with T-Mobile&#8217;s 4G network. What&#8217;s more, the 810&#8242;s Skype HD certified 1.2-megapixel front-facing camera is just a hair more robust than the VGA shooter used on the 820.</p>
<p>The Lumia 820 (and by extension, the 810) was positioned by Nokia as more of a mid-range device in comparison to the flagship Lumia 920, but T-Mobile&#8217;s Windows Phone fans are probably used to getting stuck with the mid-range treatment. After all, the last Nokia Windows Phone to hit that carrier&#8217;s magenta-tinged airwaves was the relatively dull Lumia 710 &#8212; not a bad phone by any stretch, but it came to look chintzy and unrefined compared to Nokia&#8217;s preferred Lumia 900.</p>
