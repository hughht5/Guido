Online pre-orders begin October 25, around the same time that the phone will be <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/16/samsung-galaxy-note-ii-to-hit-sprint-on-october-25-with-a-299-price-tag/">released on Sprint</a>. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/19/samsungs-galaxy-note-ii-will-launch-on-all-five-major-u-s-wireless-carriers-by-mid-november/">all five major U.S. carriers</a> will sell the second-generation Samsung phablet, but they seem to have their very own launch strategies. Thus far, Sprint and AT&amp;T are the only carriers to throw out specific dates, while T-Mobile has merely said the phone will launch <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/09/samsungs-galaxy-note-ii-coming-to-t-mobile-this-fall/">this &#8220;fall.&#8221;</a> </p>
<p>As far as pricing goes, there are no surprises here. Just like Sprint&#8217;s Galaxy Note II (and presumably every other on-contract version), AT&amp;T will be selling the Samsung Galaxy Note II for $299.99 with a two-year agreement. </p>
<p>In the specs department, nothing has been updated from what we heard at the phone&#8217;s announcement at IFA in Berlin. We&#8217;re still looking at a 1.6GHz quad-core Exynos proc, 2GB of RAM, an 8-megapixel shooter, and last but not least, a brand new S-Pen stylus thingy. </p>
<p>The display weighs in just a tad larger than its predecessors&#8217;, at 5.5 inches of Super AMOLED awesomeness. And of course, this phone will be readily equipped with a 4G LTE radio to take advantage of AT&amp;T&#8217;s new LTE network. </p>
<p>According to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.att.com/gen/press-room?pid=23454&amp;cdvn=news&amp;newsarticleid=35523&amp;mapcode=consumer|mobile-devices">the release</a>, AT&amp;T is the only carrier dropping the price of the original Galaxy Note from $299 with-contract to $199. </p>
