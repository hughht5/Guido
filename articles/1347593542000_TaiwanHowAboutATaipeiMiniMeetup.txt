To that end, I&#8217;d like to propose a small meet-up, very informal on <strong>Tuesday, September 18, 2012 at about 8pm</strong>. I know nothing about Taipei so I&#8217;m depending on you guys to recommend a location for us to meet.</p>
<p>To RSVP <a target="_blank" href="http://plancast.com/p/cve2">pop over to Plancast</a> or email me at john@techcrunch.com with the subject line &#8220;TAIPEI.&#8221; I&#8217;d love to pin down a location before the weekend so recommend what you thing would be best. I&#8217;m not sure how many we&#8217;d expect I suspect it will be something in the 50 to 80 person range.</p>
<p>I will be staying at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.palaisdechinehotel.com/zh-tw/">Palais De Chine</a> and so would prefer to have it closer to that location unless there is a cool place you guys recommend. I&#8217;d love to take your pitches and chat about the entrepreneurial environment in Taipei as well as enjoy a fine 豬血糕 on a stick.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to visiting Taiwan and meeting our local readers. Remember: this is an informal, bar-type event and not a formal presentation. Think networking, not seminar.</p>
<p>再会!</p>
