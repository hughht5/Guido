The system, based on the Japanese Felica standard, would allow authenticated power usage, power management for cafes and offices, as well as payments for power use. The system could authenticate with the power outlet via a chip inside the laptop or device or through a smartcard that user waves at the outlet.</p>
<p>According to the <a HREF="http://www.sony.co.jp/SonyInfo/News/Press/201202/12-023/index.html">press release</a>, the system will allow building and home owners to control power use from a central location and ensure people aren&#8217;t using power willy nilly.</p>
<p>This technology is definitely something we will soon see in modern buildings, at least in terms of energy maintenance. It may feel freaky to log in your power outlet, but if it keeps us from sucking down too many jiggawatts, we&#8217;ll probably all need to get on board.</p>
