By focusing on the hows and whys of notification emails, the site aims to make your inbox a cleaner place and to calm your monkey mind.</p>
<p>The brainchild of AwayFind&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/goralnick">Jared Goralnick</a>, the site contains tips and instructions for turning off notifications for multiple services. For example, I&#8217;ve used the site to turn off notifications from Facebook and Linked In and I&#8217;m much happier now that I don&#8217;t have to learn that it&#8217;s Joe Fromhighschool&#8217;s birthday or that Jane Weirdofromcollege is pregnant again.</p>
<p>The site is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.awayfind.com">part of the Awayfind</a> family and acts as a sort of advertorial for the service. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/tag/Awayfind">Awayfind</a> helps you take back your inbox by reducing the number of unimportant messages that pop up on your phone&#8217;s notification screen. By reducing your mailbox to a few select people, you can ensure you&#8217;ve got at least a fighting chance at clawing back some of your hard-won mental capacity.</p>
<p>&#8220;On NotifyMeNot, we&#8217;ve create a central place where we not only link to these kinds of notifications settings, but where we provide very specific guidance and explanations for which options to choose,&#8221; said Goralnick. He and his team are now scouring the web to find instructions and settings pages for various services to shut them up once and for all.</p>
<p><br />
The service is similar to sites like <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/01/sick-of-daily-deal-emails-unsubscribedeals-is-there-for-you/">UnsubscribeDeals.com</a> but it is not yet as automated. &#8220;It&#8217;s tricky stuff,&#8221; he said. Scripting the unsubscribe system would be nice, but doing manually helps change behavior.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want people to understand the settings, not just go to the pages, and not just click a button,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>The site is live <a target="_blank" href="http://www.notifymenot.com">now</a> and all those horrible notification emails are just waiting around to die so get shootin&#8217;.</p>
