In what I consider a first for ecommerce, guitar makers <a target="_blank" href="http://www.macmarr.com/">MacKenzie &amp; Marr</a> have taken this model to heart and are building handmade, unique guitars in China and shipping them out of their warehouse in Canada. We <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/09/mackenzie-marr-bring-guitar-making-into-the-21st-century/">profiled them a few weeks back</a> and they let me take one of their pieces for a test drive last week. I came away very impressed.</p>
<p>First, M&amp;M is a small shop. The pair, John Marr and Jon MacKenzie, have been friends since 1958 &#8211; a figure that appears prominently on every guitar &#8211; and they worked quite hard to build a very playable instrument. I&#8217;m a guitar novice, at best, but I loved the deep bass and resonation of these guitars and my teacher, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ironcityjazz.com/">Charlie Apicella</a> was amazed with the quality and sound. I definitely trust his opinion more.</p>
<p>Why is this important? Because Marr and MacKenzie can talk as big a game as they want, but if they&#8217;re not delivering, especially in an online-only business, they&#8217;re not going to sell. I think the lesson here is simple: ship strong product or quit. I don&#8217;t think this product is perfect by any degree, but these two entrepreneurs did the best they possibly could by working within existing supply chains. I see far too many &#8220;ecommerce plays&#8221; attempting to sell shoddy materials as premium items. I would equate M&amp;M with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dollarshaveclub.com">Dollar Shave Club</a> in building a compelling business around what would normally be a snoozer. Like Dollar Shave Club, the M&amp;M has twisted the traditional sales narrative into something more compelling by adding a bit of personality to the process of selling guitars.</p>
<p>For the guitar fans out there, a little about the git-fiddle itself. This is called the Summer Wages Tofino and costs $999.99. It has a cedar front with Mahogany sides and back. It has a built-in Fishman internal preamp and pickup which is attached under the sound hole. I did have some trouble getting the battery pack to stick as the glue was a bit weak, but it was nothing a good press fit couldn&#8217;t fix.</p>
<p>On its face, this is directly comparable to a Martin Dreadnought and the size and headstock would give a player pause. On closer inspection, you notice the M&amp;M inlay on the guitar as well as the hand-written label inside showing the two founders as schoolyard chums.</p>
<p>The guitar comes with a form-fitted case that looks to be <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FB5Z44/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00">a slightly customized OEM case</a> with a soft-touch outside surface and lots of fluff inside to protect the finish.</p>
<p>I was especially impressed by the playability. Highs and lows are quite clear and the whole guitar was wonderfully balanced and had a great resonance. The pickup offered an amplified sound but without much metallic vibration you see with many amplified acoustics.</p>
<p>Again, I&#8217;m no great guitarist by any stretch but I&#8217;ve held a few nice axes in my day. Although the constant referral to M&amp;M&#8217;s long friendship in the branding is a bit, shall we say, goofy, it&#8217;s a cute addition to the story. More important, however, is the dedication to quality shown in their efforts. Sure it&#8217;s made in China and sure it has some branding issues, but this is no ham-handed effort to dump a rebadged OEM product in an online store. It&#8217;s an offer of a superior product that could only be sold and distributed via the Internet.</p>
<p>The lads also offer a seven day no questions return policy, so even if you hate the guitar, it can always wing its way back to Quebec. In short, these guys are doing ecommerce right.</p>
