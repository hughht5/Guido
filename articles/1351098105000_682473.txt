<p>It&#8217;s a cliche to say that Twitter allows the everyman to connect with the movers and shakers of the media and entertainment industries. But it&#8217;s so true! Today&#8217;s case in point: the humble <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/esbarr_">Edward Barr,</a> investor and <em>WSJ</em> reader from Lexington, Kentucky, uses the communication tool to put in a complaint about the poor <em>WSJ</em> paper delivery service in his neighborhood. And he takes it right to the top, on Twitter.</p>
<p>&#8220;second time in one month no WSJ at my door,&#8221; Barr tweets at <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/rupertmurdoch/with_replies">@rupertmurdoch,</a> &#8220;In today&#8217;s world that is beyond inexcusable#especially@$438peryear. a great product that I miss when not there on timely basis#thanksforthepromptreply.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other than having a pretty wacky understanding of how to use hashtags, this print<em> WSJ</em> customer is 100% right on the money about how to get the mogul&#8217;s attention, &#8220;Yes. Where are you?&#8221; Ol&#8217; Rupey replies, to which Barr gives his location and zip code.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been about 45 minutes since this exchange, and I am left wondering whether Rupert has left his computer to get down to Kentucky and personally deliver the paper or is sending people to hack into this dude&#8217;s mailbox or mailing him a free subscription or what. It would be hilarious if he tweeted back that Barr could also read the paper online (for free if you Google specific article URLs), but that&#8217;s not going to happen.</p>
<p>This exchange is also pretty amazing because you&#8217;d think the 106th-richest person in the world would have more pressing tasks to attend to, but I guess good customer service really does begin with the CEO. The <em>WSJ&#8217;s</em> holding company NewsCorp is set to fork into two different companies by next June, <a target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303561504577493121669861262.html">splitting</a> into a more profitable, less tainted entertainment division and a media company <a target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390443624204578060670969096596.html">slated</a> to be run by Dow Jones EIC Robert Thomson.</p>
<p>We can only hope Thomson&#8217;s social media habits are just as enthralling as Murdoch&#8217;s.</p>
