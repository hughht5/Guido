After delivering four missions and four nano-missions, the MacHeist bundle now offers a full 15 apps for the low price of $29, with 25 percent of all proceeds going to charity. The company raised $850,000 for good causes with its MacHeist 3 bundle in 2009, and it&#8217;s hoping to beat that record this time around.</p>
<p>Included in the bundle this year are many top-tier Mac apps, including entertainment stand-outs like BioShock 2, Jurassic Park and Sam &amp; Max: The Devil&#8217;s Playhouse, as well as some terrific utilities and productivity apps like Scrivener and Courier. You can check out the full list of what&#8217;s available below (all of which add up to a total ordinary retail value of $540 taken together, by the way), along with links to find out more about each.</p>

<p>This year, MacHeist wants to break its previous record in terms of dollars raised for charity (which it doles out to different partner organizations based on the wishes of the MacHeist communities making the purchases), and it seems likely it will, considering that the community was only 320,000 users strong back in 2009 with 80,0000 bundles sold. Considering the community&#8217;s growth, and the quality of the apps involved and the discounts involved (BioShock 2 retails for $24.99 as a standalone app on the Mac App Store right now), I think they&#8217;ll have no trouble exceeding their target this time around.</p>
