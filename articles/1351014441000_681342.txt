These drives had a bit of flash memory that held often-accessed files &#8211; boot files, OS files, and the like &#8211; as well as plenty of old, boring spinning hard drive plates for other files. Why? Well, the flash boot section offered faster boot times while the spinning disk could &#8220;cue up&#8221; in flash if necessary to read and write. </p>
<p>In many cases, this memory was separate from the spinning drive. However, with the release of Intel&#8217;s Smart Response Technology as well as other solutions, these flash sectors became &#8220;invisible,&#8221; making the move from flash to platters instantaneous and invisible.</p>
<p>Well, Apple just got on the hybrid flight path with their new &#8220;Fusion Drive&#8221; solutions that one can only assume is some sort of Seagate partnership with special hooks in Mountain Lion built-in. In short, Apple re-invented the wheel and, presumably, made it cool to run a hybrid drive.</p>
<p>The benefit to consumers should be clear if you&#8217;ve ever used an SSD laptop. Boot times are measured in seconds, not minutes and apps hidden on the flash portion run faster and shut down more quickly. While we can&#8217;t say that Apple invented hybrid drives, I think their efforts should help popularize these drives in OEM catalogs, thus allowing everyone, not just Mac Mini and iMac users, to get a little bit more speed out of their legacy gear.</p>
<p>Embrace and extend, friends. Embrace and extend.</p>
