Following <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/17/binders-full-of-women-romney-gaffe-gets-tumblr-and-200k-likes-on-facebook/">Mitt Romney&#8217;s comment</a> about &#8220;binders full of women&#8221; at this week&#8217;s presidential debate, the customer review sections for various binders on Amazon.com have been filling up with hilarious comments. For example, see this <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Avery-Durable-Binder-EZ-Turn-17032/dp/B001B0CTMU/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top">Avery Durable View Binder</a> or this <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Avery-Economy-Binder-1-Inch-Round/dp/B000V99JYI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1350656868&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=binders">Avery Economy Binder</a>. &#8220;My advice is to be very careful when ordering, because what I received were binders full of men,&#8221; writes one reviewer. &#8220;I found it to be a little too cramped for my taste. Usually when I&#8217;m inside a binder, I like enough room to stretch out, do Pilates or just take a nap spread eagle. However, all of the women in the binder were very pleasant and I made a few great friends,&#8221; says another female shopper.</p>
<p>I know, I know, you heard about this on Reddit, like, 200 years ago (i.e., <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reddit.com/search?q=amazon+binder+reviews">yesterday</a>), but this joke is now making its way around the blogosphere, and it&#8217;s popping up all over social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook. This meme has legs!</p>

<p>Of course, sometimes I worry that the only thing many Americans will remember from the debates this year are Big Bird and binders&#8230;but I digress.</p>
<p>In case you somehow missed it, this is the quote that got the meme going:</p>
<blockquote><p>ROMNEY: Thank you. And important topic, and one which I learned a great deal about, particularly as I was serving as governor of my state, because I had the chance to pull together a cabinet and all the applicants seemed to be men.</p>
<p>And I – and I went to my staff, and I said, “How come all the people for these jobs are – are all men.” They said, “Well, these are the people that have the qualifications.” And I said, “Well, gosh, can’t we – can’t we find some – some women that are also qualified?”</p>
<p>ROMNEY: And – and so we – we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet. I went to a number of women’s groups and said, “Can you help us find folks,” and they brought us whole binders full of women. I was proud of the fact that after I staffed my Cabinet and my senior staff, that the University of New York in Albany did a survey of all 50 states, and concluded that mine had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America.</p></blockquote>
