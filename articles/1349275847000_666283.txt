<p>Apparently, in the same way that you now see Promoted Tweets in your tweet stream, you might also start seeing surveys from the @TwitterSurveys account, asking you to answer a few questions. It sounds like these surveys will measure things like your awareness of a company or brand, or your willingness to purchase a product â€” in other words, the kinds of things advertisers want to measure to determine the effectiveness of their campaign.</p>
<p>So instead of just telling advertisers that their campaign resulted in a certain number of retweets or clicks, Twitter should be able to give them a more traditional set of measurements around brand impact.</p>
<p>The surveys will appear in both mobile and desktop, the company says. Twitter is working with a small set of initial advertisers, with plans for a bigger roll out next year.</p>
