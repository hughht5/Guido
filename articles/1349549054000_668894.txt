Theories purporting otherwise are &#8220;lies&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>And it&#8217;s lies to try to keep me and all the folks who are taught that from understanding that they need a savior. You see, there are a lot of scientific data that I found out as a scientist that actually show that this is really a young Earth. I don&#8217;t believe that the Earth is but about 9,000 years old. I believe it was created in six days as we know them. That&#8217;s what the bible says!</p></blockquote>
