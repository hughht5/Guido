With that particular take, everything happens on mobile (iOS for now) with a map front and center.</p>
<p>Instead of dealing with emails and a minimum of subscribers, you launch the app and you are instantly rewarded with a series of deals. You can search, browse the map or filter by category. When you find the perfect deal, all that you&#8217; have to do is to go to the location.</p>
<p>Even to get there, with a single tap you get GPS turn-by-turnd directions from within the app. The app keeps tracks of your previous deals so that you can send them to your friends and family.</p>
<p>From the other side of the equation, business owners can manage everything instantly from the <a target="http://exploreka.co/merchant/">merchant portal</a>. After registering, you can add, edit and remove deals with a couple of clicks. The changes will be instantly reflected in the app.</p>
<p>You can even schedule deals to bring clients during off-hours. For example, the price of a certain item can be lowered from 10AM to 1PM on Friday. Merchants can view when a deal was the most viewed or the most effective.</p>
<p>Visual Frames, the company behind Exploreka, plans to monetize the service by selling the ability to push deals. After the 30-day free trial, a merchant can use the service without limits in one location for around $60 a month (or $30 a month if you pay a year upfront). 11 people are now working on the product and the company is looking for funding to expand its activities.</p>
