In fact, his talk with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/michael-arrington">Michael Arrington</a> <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/the-best-soundbites-from-mark-zuckerberg-michael-arrington-interview-vide/">last month at Disrupt</a> was his first official on-stage interview since Facebook&#8217;s initial public offering <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/18/facebook-share-open-10-5-higher-at-42/">way back in May</a>. </p>
<p>So attendees at Silicon Valley startup incubator <a target="_blank" href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator&#8217;s</a> annual <a target="_blank" href="http://startupschool.org">Startup School</a> event tomorrow are in for a real treat: Zuckerberg is slated to appear as a speaker, kicking off the day-long program being held at Stanford University in Palo Alto. </p>
<p>Co-sponsored by YC and the <a target="_blank" href="http://stvp.stanford.edu//">Stanford Technology Ventures Program</a> (STVP), Startup School is aimed at giving programmers who are thinking about starting their own companies the motivation and know-how to make the leap into the startup life. We can expect Zuckerberg and the <a target="_blank" href="http://startupschool.org/speakers.html">other speakers</a> (including Pinterest CEO <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/ben-silbermann">Ben Silbermann</a>, Stripe CEO <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/patrick-collison">Patrick Collison</a>, Uber CEO <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/travis-kalanick">Travis Kalanick</a>, and more) to talk about their own personal entrepreneurial experiences. It&#8217;s an event by hackers for hackers, so the speakers tend to be especially relaxed and candid about what it takes to build a business.</p>
<p>Applications for this year&#8217;s YC Startup School are closed and the event is completely sold out, but if you&#8217;re not already on deck to see Zuck in person don&#8217;t despair: TechCrunch will be there issuing reports from the event. You can also watch the livestream of it all from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.startupschool.org">www.startupschool.org</a>.</p>
<p>This will be the fourth year in a row that Zuckerberg is speaking at Startup School, so his attendance is a tradition of sorts at this point. In his appearance there last year, he <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/30/facebooks-zuckerberg-if-i-were-starting-a-company-now-i-would-have-stayed-in-boston/">famously said</a> that if he were starting Facebook today, he would have kept it headquartered in Boston, saying, &#8220;If I were starting now, I would have stayed in Boston. [Silicon Valley] is a little short-term focused and that bothers me.&#8221; Now that he&#8217;s put Facebook on what is meant to be the ultimate long-term track &#8212; the public stock market &#8212; it will be very interesting to hear what his perspective is like these days.</p>
