Now Facebook is following suit, allowing you to <a target="_blank" href="http://newsroom.fb.com/News/An-Update-to-Activity-Log-1bc.aspx">view and delete all or part of your search history</a> through the profile Activity Log. The new feature will give you a more transparency into what you do on Facebook, what it tracks, and make you feel like you&#8217;re more in control. The feature is beginning to roll out now</p>
<p>The change could also signal that Facebook wants to get deeper into web search, something Mark Zuckerberg discussed on stage at TechCrunch Disrupt.</p>
<p>To see your search history, go to your profile, click the Activity Log on the right side, click the &#8220;All&#8221; drop down and you&#8217;ll be able to select to view your search history. From there you can click through to re-search things you&#8217;ve looked for in the past, delete specific searches, or clear your entire history.</p>
