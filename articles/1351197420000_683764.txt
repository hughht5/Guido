But iPad sales are still declining. They are down 17.6 percent to 14 million compared to 17 million in Q3 — a bit more than expected. Analysts expected at least 15.55 million units, and sometimes more. Apple missed on those sales.</p>
<p>Last year, Apple sold 11.12 million iPads in Q4. It&#8217;s still a 25.9 percent increase year over year. Overall, Apple  <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/25/apple-q4-2012-earnings/">barely managed</a> to beat the estimates.</p>
<p>Comparatively, in Q4 2011, iPad sales increased by 166 percent year over year. Those sales were above street expectations.</p>
<p>The company just released the fourth generation iPad. And of course, there is the iPad mini. Those devices are going to be released a little bit more than a month after the ending of Q4 on September 29. It will help the sales in Q1 2013. We could expect a new sales record for the iPad in the next quarter.</p>
<p>Over the last quarter, many competitors unveiled and released tablets. The smaller form factor and the price attracted many customers. Among those tablets, we can name the Nexus 7 and the Amazon Kindle Fire HD.</p>
<p>The iPad is still a young product. When it was first released, even though tablet computers existed already, it was a big opportunity for Apple. Now that many people have bought one, the adoption rate is slowing down.</p>
<p>The iPad mini and its lower price tag will certainly help putting the device in the hands of new customers.</p>
