But iPad sales are still declining. They are down 17.6 percent to 14 million compared to 17 million in Q3. Analysts expected 15.55 million iPads sold. Apple missed on those sales.</p>
<p>Last year, Apple sold 11.12 million iPads in Q4. Those sales were above street expectations. It&#8217;s still a 25.9 percent increase year over year. Overall, Apple  <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/25/apple-q4-2012-earnings/">barely managed</a> to beat the estimates.</p>
<p>The company just released the fourth generation iPad. And of course, there is the iPad mini. Those devices are going to be released a little bit more than a month after the ending of Q4 on September 29. It will help the sales in Q1 2013. We could expect a new sales record for the iPad in the next quarter.</p>
<p>Over the last quarter, many competitors unveiled and released tablets. The smaller form factor and the price attracted many customers. Among those tablets, we can count on the Nexus 7 and the Amazon Kindle Fire HD.</p>
