Using the site&#8217;s compare tool, you can see that the 16GB model starts at $649, with the 32GB version costing $749 and the 64GB top tier configuration running $849.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the same as the iPhone 4S used to cost unlocked. That&#8217;s a considerable additional expense above and beyond the on-contract price, but you get a couple of advantages.</p>
<p>First, you&#8217;re not locked into a lengthy carrier contract, which is useful if you suddenly have to move. You can also then <a target="_blank" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/11/t-mobile-usa-says-bring-us-your-iphones/">use the iPhone on T-Mobile</a>, which is in the process of deploying a network on the 1900 MHz spectrum that will finally let the iPhone achieve top mobile broadband speeds on America&#8217;s fourth-largest carrier.</p>
<p>Choosing which unlocked device to buy will be important, however, as there are three variations that provide overseas LTE support, support for US and Canada LTE networks on the 700 MHz frequency, and support for Sprint and Verizon LTE networks respectively.</p>
