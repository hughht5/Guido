Thank goodness. This will affect everyone using Google Apps: businesses, educational and government institutions. The drop of support officially starts November 15th, a few weeks after Internet Explorer 10 launches.</p>
<p>This means no support for GMail, no Calendar, no Drive, no anything for Internet Explorer 8. Good riddance.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what the <a target="_blank" href="http://googleappsupdates.blogspot.com/2012/09/supporting-modern-browsers-internet.html">team had to say</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As we announced last year, we support the latest version of Google Chrome (which automatically updates whenever it detects that a new version of the browser is available) as well as the current and prior major release of Firefox, Internet Explorer and Safari on a rolling basis. Each time a new version of one of these browsers is released, we begin supporting the update and stop supporting the third-oldest version.</p>
<p>Internet Explorer 10 launches on 10/26/2012, and as a result, we will discontinue support for Internet Explorer 8 shortly afterwards, on 11/15/2012. After this date users accessing Google Apps services using Internet Explorer 8 will see a message recommending that they upgrade their browser.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t think anyone will be crying over this, however, for companies who don&#8217;t get their workstations properly updated, this could cause some issues for sure.</p>
