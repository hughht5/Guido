The company&#8217;s main product is currently <a target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/tokyootakumode">its popular Facebook Page</a>, but it plans to launch a website and mobile apps at well. And to help make that happen, it has enlisted Andy Miller, a former Apple mobile executive, as an advisor.</p>
<p>Miller is currently<a target="_blank" href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/07/17/leap-motion-andy-miller-ceo/"> president and COO of Leap Motion</a>. Before that, he was a partner at Highland Capital Partners. He also co-founded and served as CEO at mobile ad network Quattro Wireless. After Quattrao was acquired by Apple, Miller became the vice president of mobile advertising for Apple&#8217;s iAd program. So why is he working with an anime startup? Here&#8217;s the explanation he offers in the press release:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am happy to support the development of TOM&#8217;s community of manga and anime fans from around the world. The passion of the anime and manga community, and the thirst for content and a place to share has led to the explosive growth of TOM. I am excited to help this community connect across web, smart phones and their tablet devices.</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s a more personal connection too, according Tokyo Otaku Mode co-founder Nao Kodaka — Miller&#8217;s son is an otaku himself. (Otaku is the Japanese word for these types of fans.)</p>
<p>When Kodaka first contacted me, I was a little skeptical about the concept. I&#8217;m not terribly knowledgable about anime or manga, but I&#8217;ve known enough fans to realize that there&#8217;s no shortage of sites catering to those interests. However,, Kodaka says that none of the established sites are doing enough on social media.</p>
<p>Tokyo Otaku Mode, on the other hand, led with its social media presence. In fact, you still need an invite to access <a target="_blank" href="https://otakumode.com/login">the company&#8217;s website</a>, which is in alpha testing. On the other hand, the company has already built a thriving community on Facebook. The Otaku Mode Facebook Page has received 6.7 million likes — making it one of the fastest-growing entertainment pages, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.socialbakers.com/facebook-pages/type/entertainment/">according to Socialbakers</a>. (Kodaka also says that 99 percent of its fanbase is outside Japan.) The Anime News Network, on the other hand, has only received 58,000 likes.</p>
<p>So what has the startup done to attract such a big following? The formula seems pretty simple, at least for now. It&#8217;s posting images and other content related to anime, manga, and cosplay. The page is curated pretty carefully, Kodaka says, so fans know they&#8217;re going to get high quality content. An average piece Otaku Mode content receives about 10,000 likes.</p>
<p>Joi Ito, director of the MIT Media Lab, is already an advisor, and the company has <a target="_blank" href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/07/30/tokyo-otaku-mode-raises-angel-funding-for-anime-fan-content/">raised seed funding</a> from 500 Startups and others.</p>
