While it had struck deals to bring video subscribers more than 116 channels, at the time of its announcement, it was missing some notable channels &#8212; stuff like ESPN, Disney, AMC, TBS, TNT, and HBO.</p>
<p>Well, Google&#8217;s been working diligently to correct that, striking deals to bring on more networks to match competing offerings from incumbent cable and satellite TV providers. Earlier in the week, Google announced that it had <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/google-fiber-adds-new-tv-channels-ahead-of-signup-launch/">added channels from mega-conglomerate Disney</a>, bringing networks like ABC Family, Disney Channel, and all the various ESPN channels to its lineup. That brought the total number of channels up to about 200.</p>
<p>Today, Google announced it has also <a target="_blank" href="http://googlefiberblog.blogspot.com/2012/09/even-more-channels-on-google-fiber-tv.html">added content from Time Warner&#8217;s Turner Broadcasting</a>. The Turner deal will provide channels like Boomerang, Cartoon Network, CNN, CNN en Espa√±ol, CNN International, HLN, hTV, infinito, TBS, TCM: Turner Classic Movies, TNT, and truTV. That brings Google mostly up to parity with other distributors, and at $120 a month for TV and 1Gbps broadband, the offering is competitively priced. </p>
<p>The announcement of new content comes as Kansas City residents now wait to get their fiber actually installed. Google announced earlier this week that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/09/google-fiber-kansas-city-goals-reached/">180 out of 202 &#8220;fiberhoods&#8221; in the city had reached their goals</a> for rollout. But Google said it could take up to halfway through next year for half of its markets to be finished. The good news is that when it is ready, those customers will have a more complete TV package. </p>
