You may remember that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/13/iphone-4s-pre-orders-sold-out-at-sprint-verizon-and-att/">it took 22 hours for the iPhone 4S</a> and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/06/15/iphone-4-sold-out/">about 20 hours for the iPhone 4</a> to sell out of its pre-order, launch-day stock. </p>
<p>The iPhone 5 took just about 60 minutes. Yep. One hour after pre-orders went live tonight, Apple.com shifted shipping expectations from one to two weeks due to the overwhelming demand.</p>
<p>Demand for the phone caused problems on Apple&#8217;s website and several of the wireless carriers&#8217; sites, as many users saw error messages as they attempted to buy the phone. While there were no problems for the 4S, the iPhone 4 also had pre-order issues.</p>
<p>The iPhone 5 was the subject of seemingly endless rumor posts all summer and when it finally was released, it was received positively but didn&#8217;t receive the usual level of gushing reviews. The changes look great&#8211;the bigger screen and faster Internet are my personal favorites&#8211;but the device certainly isn&#8217;t so much better than the iPhone 4 and 4s to validate it selling out pre-orders 20 times faster.</p>
<p>And yet, people still are buying it in massive numbers.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;Available to ship: 2 weeks&#8221;&#8230;man that last week it&#8217;s gonna feel like you have an old cement block in your pocket. </em></p>
<p>I guess I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised anymore that the machine runs so efficiently and keeps exceeding expectations. But I am. Mostly because of how rampant the obsession is to buy the next generation of iPhone as soon as possible.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/13/the-iphone-5-event/">MG Siegler wrote yesterday</a> about the way Apple showcases these events, discussing the turn and the prestige. But a couple of sentences really jumped out at me beyond the presentation of the phone. The bottom line:</p>
<blockquote><p>That’s why Apple is now the most valuable company in the world. And that’s why you will buy an iPhone 5. And an iPhone 6. And beyond.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s what really matters. The bottom line sits atop everything else. And the bottom line is that despite the phone not having many drastic changes and a lack of an overwhelming &#8220;wow&#8221; factor, so many people went online in the middle of the night on a workday to shell out hundreds of dollars for a pre-order that sites were crashing and the first batch of product sold out.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Apple is the most valuable company in the world.</p>
