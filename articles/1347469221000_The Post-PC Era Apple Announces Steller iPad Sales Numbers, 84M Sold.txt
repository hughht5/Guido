Sales of the Apple iPad is exploding, with the company announcing it sold 84M units through June. </p>
<p>The iPad now accounts for 63% of the worldwide tablet marketshare between April and June &#8212; at least according to Apple&#8217;s numbers.</p>
<p>&#8220;iPad is driving the post PC revolution,&#8221; said Tim Cook this morning at a company press event adding that the iPad accounts for 91% of web traffic of all tablets. &#8220;Now I don&#8217;t know what these other tablets are doing? They must be in warehouses or store shelves or maybe someone&#8217;s bottom drawer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apple sold 17M iPads between April and June and 84M overall since its launch. Even with a constant flow of new competitors, the iPad continues to outpace every other model. </p>
