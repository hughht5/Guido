<p>Depending on how you look at it, this is either the first floating four-wheeler, or the first jet ski with wheels. Either way, it&#8217;s awesome from just about any perspective.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gibbssports.com/quadski">Quadski</a>, as they say, comes from the same guy who created an amphibious car, called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/06/13/gibbs-aquada-amphibious-vehicle-to-come-ashore-in-the-us/">Aquada</a>. His name is Alan Gibbs, and he was able to build himself a working prototype of the vehicle, but silly automotive laws in the U.S. (like, you know, required airbags) kept him from manufacturing the wheelie-boat on a large scale.</p>
<p>But the Quadski is different from the Aquada, as it functions more as a single-person vehicle â€” a hybrid between an ATV and a jet ski.</p>
<p>It can go 45mph on both land and water, which isn&#8217;t quite what you can see on some ATVs, but still respectable, and takes four seconds to switch between the sea and the earth. Oh, and pre-orders will open soon at the price of $40,000.</p>
<p>According to Gibbs, the company will move 1,000 units in the first year, high price point and all.</p>
