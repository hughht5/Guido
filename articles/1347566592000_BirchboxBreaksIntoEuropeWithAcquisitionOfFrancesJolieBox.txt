Terms of the deal aren&#8217;t being disclosed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We knew it was always on the roadmap for Birchbox to be global,&#8221; said <a target="_blank" href="http://www.birchbox.com/about/birchbox/katia-beauchamp">Birchbox&#8217;s co-chief executive Katia Beauchamp</a>. &#8220;What we offer resonates globally with consumers and, furthermore, we work with so many global brands that we wanted to serve them in other markets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Birchbox&#8217;s strategy is to be a powerful customer acquisition tool for beauty brands and products. Every month for $10, the Accel-backed company sends its subscribers a box full of sample products ranging from lotions to lipstick and mascara. If customers like what they see, they can go on Birchbox&#8217;s site and buy more, giving the company affiliate revenue (which is actually a significant part of the its overall business). Birchbox had at least 100,000 subscribers as of April, but they haven&#8217;t updated that number since.</p>
<p>With the JolieBox acquisition, Birchbox gets about 35 employees plus a presence in France, the UK, and several other continental markets.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not disclosing the exact number of subscribers JolieBox brings, but it&#8217;s a significant increase for us,&#8221; Beauchamp said. &#8220;It gives us a great headstart.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unlike purely web-based products or mobile apps, e-commerce startups often have to buy competitors abroad for international reach (because on-the-ground presence is necessary and there are higher barriers to entry in local markets). To make it internationally, Groupon had to acquire numerous group-buying clones abroad, most notably Germany&#8217;s CityDeal from the Samwer brothers. Notably, the Samwers&#8217; clone Glossybox is <em>not</em> the target of this acquisition.</p>
<p>Expect Birchbox to continue doing the same going forward. They&#8217;ve raised nearly $12 million in two rounds from Accel Partners, Harrison Metal, First Round, Forerunner Ventures, and Lerer Ventures.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know we will continue to look at global opportunities,&#8221; Beauchamp said. &#8220;We want to be the definitive market leader, so we&#8217;ll be looking beyond Europe and in Asia and South America.&#8221;</p>
