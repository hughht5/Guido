We&#8217;ve decided on a location &#8211; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ontaptaipei.com">OnTap Taipei</a> &#8211; on <strong>Tuesday, September 18, 2012, at about 8pm</strong>.</p>
<p>To RSVP <a target="_blank" href="http://plancast.com/p/cve2">pop over to Plancast</a> or email me at john@techcrunch.com with the subject line “TAIPEI.” </p>
<p>Special thanks to Richard from VIA who helped out planning this little soiree. </p>
<p>I’d love to take your pitches and chat about the entrepreneurial environment in Taipei. Remember: This is an informal, bar-type event and not a formal presentation. Think networking, not seminar.</p>
<p>See you on Tuesday!</p>
