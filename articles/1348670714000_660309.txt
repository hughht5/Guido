Today it was announced that it is buying ESN, developers of the Planet web-based games framework, for an undisclosed sum. The two had already been working together, namely on <a target="_blank" href="http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/gate/">Battlelog</a>, an online component for Battlefield 3. The news was announced on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.esn.me/news/read/20/ea-acquires-esn/">ESN&#8217;s blog</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We couldnâ€™t be more excited about this opportunity and the team is looking forward to focus all of its energy on DICE, Battlelog and the Battlefield series,&#8221; the company&#8217;s founders write.</p>
<p>It also notes that it is on the lookout to hire more developers. </p>
<p>More to come.</p>
