Today it was announced that it is buying ESN, developers of the Planet web-based games framework, for an undisclosed sum. The two companies had already been working together, namely on <a target="_blank" href="http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/gate/">Battlelog</a>, an online social-web component for EA&#8217;s <em>Battlefield 3</em>. The news was announced on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.esn.me/news/read/20/ea-acquires-esn/">ESN&#8217;s blog</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We couldnâ€™t be more excited about this opportunity and the team is looking forward to focus all of its energy on <a target="_blank" href="http://dice.se/">DICE</a> [EA's existing Swedish studio], Battlelog and the Battlefield series,&#8221; the company&#8217;s founders write.</p>
<p>It also notes that it is on the lookout to hire more developers. </p>
<p>The fact that EA already had Dice in Sweden probably means that the two will consolidate, but still remain in Sweden.</p>
<p>Electronic Arts, which started as a games publisher for consoles, has over the last few years been trying to reposition itself to be closer to where its audience is moving: into online social and casual gaming and mobile. In that, it has had some run-ins with other companies also trying to keep strong positions in those spaces. It is currently suing Zynga, alleging that the social games maker&#8217;s <em>The Ville</em> is a ripoff of its <em>Sims Social</em> Facebook game.</p>
<p>And while it is expanding in some places, it is consolidating in others. Just yesterday it was announced that it was closing the Dublin office of PopCap, making nearly 100 employees redundant, as part of a bigger re-org and downsizing of the Seattle-based studio, which EA bought in <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/12/confirmed-ea-buys-popcap-games-for-750-million-plus-earn-out/">July 2011</a> for $750 million, with a potential earnout taking that to $1.3 billion.</p>
<p>More to come.</p>
