Turns out, those rumors were true. Google&#8217;s Motorola Mobility unit just announced that it has indeed acquired the company.</p>
<p>Here is the statement we just received from a Motorola spokesperson:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Motorola Mobility today announced that it has acquired Viewdle, a leading imaging &amp; gesture recognition company.  Motorola and Viewdle have an existing commercial agreement and have been collaborating for some time. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Previous to this acquisition, a source close the company told us earlier this week, Viewdle had already been in acquisition talks with Google around 2008 and with Motorola around the same time the company was acquired by Google.</p>
<p>Viewdle was founded in Ukraine in 2006 and still keeps a considerable presence there, but the company is now headquartered in Silicon Valley.</p>
