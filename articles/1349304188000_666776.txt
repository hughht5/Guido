Turns out, those rumors were true. Google&#8217;s Motorola Mobility unit just announced that it has indeed acquired the company.</p>
<p>Here is the statement we just received from a Motorola spokesperson:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Motorola Mobility today announced that it has acquired&nbsp;Viewdle, a leading imaging &amp; gesture recognition company. &nbsp;Motorola and&nbsp;Viewdle&nbsp;have an existing commercial agreement and have been collaborating for some time. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.”</p></blockquote>
