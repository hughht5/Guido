<p>&#8220;I will meet Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt on Thursday in Seoul,&#8221; Shin Jong-kyun is quoted as saying at a launch event held in Seoul for the unveiling of the Galaxy Note II.</p>
<p>The paper reports that Samsung &#8212; which uses Google&#8217;s Android OS to power smartphones and tablets &#8212; plans to pull Google into its patents battle with Apple. But it says Shin Jong-kyun declined to give further details about what would be discussed, saying only that strategic meetings with carriers in the U.S. would take place next week.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Samsung and Google for confirmation of the meeting and what will be discussed.</p>
<p>In August <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/24/apple-wins-patent-ruling-as-jury-finds-samsung-infringes/">Apple won a $1.049 billion patent damages ruling against Samsung</a> for infringing design and software patents. Earlier this month <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/22/apples-707m-u-s-sales-ban-filing-against-samsung-underscores-one-of-apples-biggest-concerns/">Apple filed more legal filings against Samsung</a> &#8211; requesting a further $707 million in damages and also filing a request for a sales ban on all of Samsung’s Android handsets. Meanwhile, Samsung is also litigating against Apple on patents grounds &#8212; most recently <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/20/samsung-confirms-iphone-5-to-join-the-ranks-of-existing-patent-lawsuits/">Samsung confirmed it plans to add the iPhone 5 to its &#8216;accused products&#8217; list</a> in an ongoing suit.</p>
<p>The ongoing legal battles do not appear to be putting Samsung off its mobile market share lunch: the paper also reports Samsung has revised its total handset sales target for this year &#8212; to 400 million, up from the 370 million originally projected.</p>
<p>One example of Samsung ramping up its mobile efforts is that it&#8217;s pushing the sequel to its Galaxy Note phablet &#8212; the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/29/samsung-note-2/">Galaxy Note II</a> &#8212; to a lot more carriers. &#8220;In the United States, the Galaxy Note was only introduced via AT&amp;T. But the Note II will be released by all major U.S. carriers,&#8221; Shin Jong-kyun told the paper.</p>
<p>Apple sold <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2012/09/24iPhone-5-First-Weekend-Sales-Top-Five-Million.html">five million units of its latest smartphone</a>, the iPhone 5, on the opening weekend alone. At the iPhone 5 launch event, CEO Tim Cook announced that a total of 400 million iOS devices (iPhones, iPads, iPod Touches) had been sold as of June 2012 &#8212; which may be one reason why Samsung is bullishly rounding up its handset sales projection to a cool 400 million.</p>
<p>A <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asymco.com/2012/09/17/projecting-ios-devices-through-itunes-account-growth/">recent forecast by Horace Dediu of Asymco</a> &#8211; using iTunes accounts to project iOS device sales &#8212; predicts Apple will pass one billion iOS devices sales by late 2014 or early 2015.</p>
