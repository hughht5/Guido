Called &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/everloop-goobit/id556166326?mt=8">Goobit</a>&#8221; (remember folks, this is an app for kids), the new app brings the Everloop interface mobile, and includes one of the network&#8217;s more popular features &#8211; &#8220;goobs,&#8221; the silly pranks which let kids do things like splatter virtual bugs or toilet paper each others&#8217; screens.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m told this is fun, and it makes me feel ancient.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/25/social-network-everloop-hits-mobile-with-new-goobit-app-yes-its-for-kids/goobit_select_goobs_iphone4/" rel="attachment wp-att-683495"></a>In any event, Everloop&#8217;s app presents a safer alternative for kids&#8217; social networking, than allowing them to lie about their age in order to set up an account on Facebook, as many unfortunately do. The app is COPPA-compliant, of course, which parents will like. And there&#8217;s also a spirit of celebrating just being a kid on Everloop, which is refreshing in a world where kids are growing up too fast (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/20/health/boys-early-puberty/index.html">literally</a>). Meant for children 13 and under, Everloop hopes to at least stall children from heading off into grown-up social networking spaces before they&#8217;ve adopted the social skills to handle what it means to have a virtual presence. It lets them practice their online skills during a critical time in their lives &#8211; when they have yet to fully grasp the power that virtual actions can have on others.</p>
<p></p>
<p>More importantly, Everloop offers a variety of social activities for kids, without the embarrassment of mom commenting on kids&#8217; posts. Parents are kept informed through notifications, but this is <em>not</em> their network &#8211; it&#8217;s for the kids. A moderation team at the company keeps kids from taking things too far, and prevents posts with swear words, cyberbullying, or other inappropriate content from being posted. When it&#8217;s caught, the kids are notified why that message can&#8217;t be posted. (For more on Everloop&#8217;s network, see our earlier post <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/06/kid-friendly-social-network-everloop-is-coming-to-iphone-raising-series-a/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>In the new mobile app, kids can upload and share photos, post status updates, comment and like things on their own loops and those of their friends (loops are interest-based communities around topics like soccer, kittens, or Justing Bieber), send each other direct messages, share photos and videos from the web, and, as noted above, prank each other using &#8220;goobs.&#8221;</p>
<p>To kick off the launch, Everloop is also including a Goobit Halloween Decorations Contest which lets the kids upload pictures of wacky Halloween decorations in order to win credits. These credits allow the kids to buy virtual goods in Everloop.</p>
<p>The Goobit app is available now <a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/everloop-goobit/id556166326?mt=8">in the iTunes App Store</a>, and works on iPhone and iPod Touch.</p>
