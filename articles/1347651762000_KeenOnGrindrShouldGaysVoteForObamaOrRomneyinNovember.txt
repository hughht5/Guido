<p>Given the ubiquity and power of today&#8217;s online networks, it&#8217;s become a cliche to describe the race between Obama and Romney as a social media election. But few social networks have become as explicitly engaged as the 4 million person strong gay network <a target="_blank" href="http://grindr.com/equality">Grindr</a> in pursuing the human rights of its members. As Grindr&#8217;s CEO <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/17/grindrs-joel-simkhai-announces-4m-users-1m-daily-uniques-and-weighs-in-on-the-skout-disaster/">Joel Simkhai</a> told me at Disrupt, that&#8217;s because gay men don&#8217;t have equality in America. Thus Simkhai has launched <a target="_blank" href="http://grindr.com/equality">Grindr For Equality</a> &#8211; an initiative designed to educate gays about relevant issues in the upcoming election.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not about the parties,&#8221; Simkhai explained Grindr For Equality to me. Instead, Simkhai insisted, it&#8217;s all about informing Grinkr members about politicians&#8217; positions on issues like gay marriage. That&#8217;s all very well, of course. But, as I asked Simkhai, who should gay people vote for in November?  Would it be President Obama or President Romney who would most pursue legal equality for the gay community in America?</p>
