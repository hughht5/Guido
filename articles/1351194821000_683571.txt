<p>Even though Microsoft has had a hell of time catching up with Google and Apple as tablet sales have eaten into PC marketshare, there is some hope. There are startups betting that the new Windows 8 OS will keep help Microsoft&#8217;s developer ecosystem relevant, if not make it stronger.</p>
<p>Parse, a YC-backed startup that eases back-end mobile app development, <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.parse.com/2012/10/25/introducing-the-parse-windows-8-sdk/">is releasing an SDK for Windows 8</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think Windows 8 will be an important contender and we want our existing clients to be able to build apps on Day One,&#8221; said co-founder Ilya Sukhar. &#8220;People in the Valley don&#8217;t quite realize how big the Microsoft developer ecosystem and how entrenched it is in many big enterprises.&#8221;</p>
<p>Developers writing in a .NET language such as C# or Visual Basic can use access all of the same Parse features that Android or iOS developers can. Alternately, they can use it even if they&#8217;re writing in JavaScript. Parse supports special .NET features like LINQ as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s this whole pool of enterprise developers who love C# who have been chomping at the bit,&#8221; Sukhar said. &#8220;Plus the Surface tablet looks great.&#8221;</p>
<p>Parse, which has billed itself in the past as the &#8220;Heroku for mobile&#8221;, takes care of common back-end issues that many mobile developers face like how to handle storage, user authentication and push notifications.</p>
<p>Sukhar said the company has entered a &#8220;hyper-growth&#8221; phase. He said Parse doubled revenue last month and is still growing 30 percent month-over-month in terms of apps and traffic. The company is supporting about 40,000 apps and roughly the same number of developers. They&#8217;re adding a sales team to help accelerate that growth.</p>
<p>Parse has a freemium model, with a free basic version and then higher tiers of service that cost anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars per month.</p>
<p>The company is backed with $7 million funding from Ignition Partners, Google Ventures, Menlo Ventures and YC partners like Aaron Iba and Garry Tan. Sukhar said the company&#8217;s still undecided about doing a Series B round.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not talking to anyone actively. We&#8217;re holding off and trying to stay focused,&#8221; Sukhar said.</p>
