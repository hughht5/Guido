<p>The financial terms of the deal are not being disclosed. NewsCred did say that it expects to bring all of Daylife&#8217;s employees over to the new team. The company also said that the acquisition should effectively double its revenue and customer base.</p>
<p>NewsCred will continue to support Daylife&#8217;s cloud publishing products — NewsCred co-founder and CEO Shafqat Islam said those products &#8220;will continue to work uninterrupted and seamlessly.&#8221; He also argued that the two companies&#8217; products suites are complementary. Brands and publishers that run content from NewsCred (whose content is licensed in turn from partners like The Associated Press and the Guardian) can use Daylife&#8217;s publishing tools (such as Daylife&#8217;s Smart Gallery feature) to build better reader experiences around that content. Meanwhile, the customers who use Daylife&#8217;s publishing tools will be able to access articles and media licensed from Newscred&#8217;s 1,000-plus publisher partners.</p>
<p>The two companies already have a connection via Getty Images. Daylife had previously raised $12.3 million in funding, from Arts Alliance Ventures, Balderton Capital, and, yes, Getty, which is also a content partner with NewsCred. Islam said he&#8217;s hoping this acquisition will &#8220;deepen&#8221; NewsCred&#8217;s connection to Getty.</p>
<p>In the next few months, NewsCred plans to launch new products that integrate the two experiences, Islam said.</p>
<p>Perhaps coincidentally, NewsCred also just filed <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1560004/000156000412000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">a Form D</a> with the Securities and Exchange Commission stating that it has raised $1.75 million in new funding. However, the filing states that this isn&#8217;t an equity round of funding, but instead involves debt and &#8220;Option, Warrant or Other Right to Acquire Another Security,&#8221; so the exact nature of the transaction is a bit fuzzy, at least to me. When asked about the filing, Islam said, &#8220;Unfortunately I can&#8217;t comment on any financing-related details for legal reasons.&#8221;</p>
