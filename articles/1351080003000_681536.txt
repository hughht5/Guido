The venture firm is backing <a target="_blank" href="http://angelprime.com/">AngelPrime,</a> a Bangalore-based incubator. The investment will be used as seed capital for the companies that AngelPrime plans to incubate over the next 3 years and to fund the operations of AngelPrime.</p>
<p>AngelPrime’s founding partners, Bala Parthasarathy, Shripati Acharya and Sanjay Swamy, previously founded Snapfish (acquired by Hewlett Packard), ZipDial, and worked at Cisco, IBM and Xerox.</p>
<p>The organization&#8217;s model is similar to that of U.S. based incubators, but at a smaller scale. Partners work closely with entrepreneurs to incubate companies, provide hands-on mentoring, seed capital of approximately $200,000 to $500,000, and a co-working facility in Bangalore. The AngelPrime team has actively incubated 3 companies in the past two years including ZipDial, Ezetap and Unamia, and plans to incubate another 3 companies per year.</p>
<p>The investment is led by Mayfield&#8217;s Managing Director Navin Chaddha, “Our motto at Mayfield Fund is to invest in relationships and we have known the world-class team members at AngelPrime since their Snapfish days,” said Chaddha. “We believe that a *global playbook* approach to investing which identifies trends that work across borders but are customized to specific geographies will yield several industry-leading companies out of India. But it will require heavy lifting at the earliest stages from an experienced and passionate team such as the one at AngelPrime.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chaddha says the investment was made out of its Mayfield India Fund, which raised $111 million in 2008. Chaddha says that the fund focuses primarily on non-tech opportunities in India, because the market is still nascent. But AngelPrime&#8217;s model is attractive because the incubator is going deep on a few companies. While seed stage funds are emerging in India, Chaddha is bullish on AngelPrime because there aren&#8217;t as any incubators in the country.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, AngelPrime launched Ezetap, a mobile Point-of-Sale solution that allows any merchant or agent to capture credit or debit card payments in the field using their mobile handset or tablet.</p>
