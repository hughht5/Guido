According to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/x_factor/4563750/Its-Billiam-as-Simon-Cowell-and-rapper-Will-join-forces-to-find-the-new-Bill-Gates.html">The Sun,</a> the former American Idol and current X Factor judge is teaming up with Black Eyed Peas rapper Will.i.am to find the next hot tech entrepreneur.</p>
