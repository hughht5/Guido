In all, 5 percent of the company&#8217;s full-time workforce is being let go. As of the end of this March, the company had 2,916 employees so the final tally is probably close to 150 layoffs.</p>
<p>The key details are that the company is sunsetting 13 games and is significantly reducing its investment in its life simulation game The Ville, which as we reported earlier is being sent to the Zynga&#8217;s India offices for maintenance. </p>
<p>The company also confirmed that it&#8217;s shutting down the Boston office, as we reported earlier. Zynga is also proposing the closure of its U.K. and Japanese studios. Most of the offices began as acquisitions, actually. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/17/zynga-buys-bostons-conduit-labs/">Boston was Conduit Labs</a>, while <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/06/04/sec-filing-suggests-zynga-paid-at-least-20-5-million-for-challenge-games/">the Austin office came out of the Challenge Games&#8217; acquisition</a> and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/27/zynga-continues-international-expansion-acqhires-uk-mobile-gaming-studio-wonderland-software/">the U.K. development efforts grew out of the deal to buy Wonderland Software</a>. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/05/zynga-confirms-unoh-acquisition/">Zynga Japan came out of the Unoh acquisition</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the confirmation. We&#8217;ll be updating shortly:</p>
<p>INTERNAL NOTE FROM ZYNGA CEO AND FOUNDER, MARK PINCUS</p>
<p>Team,</p>
<p>Earlier today we initiated a number of changes to streamline our operations, focus our resources on our most strategic opportunities, and invest in our future. We waited to share this news with all of you until we had first spoken with the groups impacted.</p>
<p>As part of these changes, we’ve had to make some tough decisions around products, teams and people.  I want to fill you in on what&#8217;s happened and address any concerns you may have.</p>
<p>Here are the most important details. </p>
<p>We are sunsetting 13 older games and we’re also significantly reducing our investment in The Ville.</p>
<p>We are closing the Zynga Boston studio and proposing closures of the Zynga Japan and UK studios.  Additionally, we are reducing staffing levels in our Austin studio.  All of these represent terrific entrepreneurial teams, which make this decision so difficult.</p>
<p>In addition to these studios, we are also making a small number of partner team reductions. </p>
<p>In all, we will unfortunately be parting ways with approximately 5% of our full time workforce.  We don’t take these decisions lightly as we recognize the impact to our colleagues and friends who have been on this journey with us.  We appreciate their amazing contributions and will miss them.</p>
<p>This is the most painful part of an overall cost reduction plan that also includes significant cuts in spending on data hosting, advertising and outside services, primarily contractors.</p>
<p>These reductions, along with our ongoing efforts to implement more stringent budget and resource allocation around new games and partner projects, will improve our profitability and allow us to reinvest in great games and our Zynga network on web and mobile.</p>
<p>Zynga made social gaming and play a worldwide phenomenon, and we remain the industry leader.  Our success has come from our dedication to a simple and powerful proposition – that play is not just something people do to pass time, it’s a core need for every person and culture.</p>
<p>We will all be discussing these difficult changes more with our teams and as a company.  Tomorrow, Dave and I will be hosting a post-earnings webcast (details to follow) and next week we will be discussing our broader vision and strategy during our quarterly all-hands meeting.  I’m confident this puts us on the right path to deliver on the promise of social gaming and make Zynga into an internet treasure.</p>
<p>If you have any immediate questions, I hope you will talk directly with your manager, Colleen, or me. </p>
<p>I look forward to talking with you tomorrow.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
