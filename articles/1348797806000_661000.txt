<p>Normally, if a business has a landing page that it thinks could be driving more user registrations (or purchases, or whatever they&#8217;re aiming for), then it has to devote time and resources on a redesign that may or may not actually improve things. With Pluralis, businesses can crowdsource the problem, challenging &#8220;creative optimizers&#8221; (a category that includes copywriters, designers, and marketers) to compete to create the best page.</p>
<p>To do that, businesses first post a contest offering different payments depending on how much their conversion rates are improved. (For example, it could offer $1,000 for 15 percent improvement, $2,000 for 30 percent, and so on.) Then the creative optimizers who have been enlisted by Pluralis can take their stab at doing better, using the company&#8217;s tools to page elements including the text, images, and headers.</p>

<p>Once the submission phase is over, businesses choose the revisions that they like the best, and they A/B test those submissions live on the site. In order to win, a design has to perform better than all of the other submissions, as well as the existing page. In other words, businesses should end up with the landing page that&#8217;s proven to be the best. And if nothing is actually better than what they have already, they don&#8217;t have to pay anything.</p>
<p>Pluralis just opened the service to the public, but it has been beta testing the program with help desk company <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sysaid.com">SysAid</a>, ad company <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jottix.com">Jottix Media</a>, and others, with an average of 17 to 27 percent improvement in conversion rates.</p>
<p>The company has raised $1 million in seed funding from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thetime.co.il/">Thetime</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cyhawk.com">Cyhawk Ventures</a>.</p>
