Now that fear seems confirmed. As we learned today, the <a target="_blank" href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/MD824ZM/A/lightning-to-30-pin-adapter-02-m?fnode=48">Lightning to 30-pin adapter</a> come with an important caveat: &#8220;Video and iPod Out not supported.&#8221; This means thousands if not millions of devices <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/14/apple-is-creating-an-e-waste-problem/">will become e-waste</a>. </p>
<p>But are we sure these adapters won&#8217;t work?</p>
<p>I reached out to a major iPod dock company this morning and got a reply that should disconcert anyone with a dock in their home. The company rep, who will remain nameless, wrote back:</p>
<div style="margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px;padding-left:15px;border-left:3px solid #ccc;font-style:italic;">We will be evaluating compatibility of our current products with the<br />
new Apple adapter once it becomes available. Please feel free to check back in with us at that time.
</div>
<p>This company makes some of the best-known docks in the market and I sincerely doubt they aren&#8217;t aware of these compatibility issues at this late date. Yet this answer is troubling: if these guys don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s up with Lightning, who does? </p>
<p>We probably won&#8217;t know much about Lightning architecture until devices are in users&#8217; hands and arguably Apple isn&#8217;t at fault here &#8211; they&#8217;re pushing their technology forward as any sane company would. But what we have here is a Schrödinger&#8217;s cat of port technology and I&#8217;m leaning towards the cat being dead.</p>
