<p>The news was announced in a tweet on Jolla&#8217;s Twitter account (h/t to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tonistechblog.com/">tonistechblog</a> for spotting)</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Jolla watch changes as we focus on product delivery. @<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/marcdillondotfi">marcdillondotfi</a> is new CEO, @<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/jussihurmola">jussihurmola</a> focuses to Sailfish strategy. Onwards sails!</p>
<p>— Jolla (@JollaMobile) <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/JollaMobile/status/257777374551232513">October 15, 2012</a></p></blockquote>
<p>At the time of writing, Jolla had not responded to a request for further comment on the exec reshuffle but the company&#8217;s tweet points to a new focus on product delivery as it draws closer to the big reveal of Sailfish &#8212; due to take place at the <a target="_blank" href="http://slush.fi/en/">Slush</a> startup conference in Helsinki, Finland, on November 21-22.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: A Jolla spokesperson said regular executive reshuffles are part of the startup&#8217;s business development strategy &#8212; noting: &#8221;Regular rotation is a part of our company culture that keeps us agile and our way of working well matched to the most important tasks at hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>In this case, Jolla&#8217;s priority is focusing on product delivery. &#8221;This is a good move as the product delivery is our #1 focus,&#8221; said the spokesperson. &#8220;Marc has been in charge of the engineering and product development right from the start and the move will now maximise the delivery efficiency. At the same time, it&#8217;s elementary that we also look beyond the first launch and Jussi&#8217;s new role i.e. focusing on further developing the Sailfish strategy and the whole ecosystem will be very important for Jolla.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dillon assumes the CEO role &#8220;with immediate effect&#8221;, the spokesperson added.</p>
