<p>I&#8217;ve avoided posting videos of people shooting the iPhone with bullets, dropping iPhones into squirrel pens, and ingesting and then excreting iPhones because I think such videos are wasteful and pointless. But this video is a little too cool not to post.</p>
<p>It shows 6 Watts of pure <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wickedlasers.com/">WickedLasers</a> fun being pointed at the center of an <a href="http://techcrunch.com/tag/iphone">iPhone</a> 5 screen and then, to add insult to injury, they drop a superhot flashlight onto the screen, essentially destroying the LCD. Arguably, this is the worst waste of an iPhone possible, but I do really like lasers.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve looked at <a href="http://techcrunch.com/tag/wickedlasers/">WickedLasers</a> quite a bit over the years and barring their tendency to cause permanent eye damage and/or blindness I find their products to be pretty cool, especially now that they&#8217;ve proven that the iPhone has no external defenses and can be destroyed by shooting photon torpedoes down a small exhaust port.</p>
