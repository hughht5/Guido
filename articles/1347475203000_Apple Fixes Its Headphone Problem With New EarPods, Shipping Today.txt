They don&#8217;t seal like in-ear phones, howeever, and have three ports designed to maximize air flow through the design.</p>
<p>A port in the back is aimed at delivering better mid-tones, and there&#8217;s one in the stem and the primary one for delivering sound to the inside of your ear. It&#8217;s all aimed at delivering the best sound possible.</p>
<p>These ship today standalone, and are included with new iPods and iPhone. They&#8217;ve gotta be better than the existing ones, but I&#8217;ll reserve judgement about how much better until I get actual ears-on experience.</p>
