<p>Setify, which is in private beta (but you can request an invitation), allows people to track the items that they already own, share collections of items they own, and build wish lists as well. The e-commerce giant also plans to add mobile apps, (iOS and Android) as well. Right now, Setify is still only limited to comic book and coin collections, but support for more categories of collectibles is expected to be added.</p>
<p>Interestingly, items do not need to be on eBay to be posted to Setify. Users can upload photos from their own collections and can create wish lists of items already on eBay.</p>
<p>eBay is touting this as a tool for collectors, because collectors of rare items tend to look for these on eBay. Allowing sellers to organize their collections should be a creative way to market their items in one place. </p>
<p>But you can imagine that this could be extended to all items on eBay, creating a Pinterest-like platform for users to collect and share items that they want or have purchased. And if more eBay users engage with Setify, tagging items they like or own, this gives eBay more data to help with the personalization of the marketplace&#8217;s shopping experience. </p>
