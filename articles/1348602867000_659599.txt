That&#8217;s all fine and dandy, but that&#8217;s only a small part of the problem. The real problem Apple seems to be having is with its quality assurance programs over at Foxconn. Now that more pre-ordered phones are arriving, it&#8217;s becoming pretty clear that despite Apple&#8217;s assurances that every phone is being built with nanometer precision, something is off with this first batch of iPhone 5s. How do I know? I just got one.</p>
<p>My UPS guy stopped by an hour ago and delivered my phone. Here are the problems right out of the box: something is rattling around the bottom of the phone, there are dents on the back where there aluminum back meets the class parts at the top and bottom, there are a few small but noticeable scratches on the aluminum back, too, and there is a discolored part right above the ringer switch.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/25/scuff-rattle-and-scratch-apples-iphone-5-qa-leaves-a-lot-to-be-desired/iphone5wtf/" rel="attachment wp-att-659650"></a>I&#8217;ll be the first to admit that this is the epitome of a First World problem, but this is also a device from a company that makes a big deal about how its phone was &#8220;made with a level of precision you&#8217;d expect from a finely crafted watch &#8211; not a smartphone.&#8221; Supposedly, &#8220;each iPhone 5 aluminum housing is photographed by two high-powered 29MP cameras. A machine then examines the images and compares them against 725 unique inlays to find the most precise match for every single iPhone.&#8221; Clearly, Apple needs to install some of these cameras at the end of the production line, too.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m clearly not the only one with these problems. Apple&#8217;s own discussion forums are <a target="_blank" href="https://discussions.apple.com/message/19753955#19753955">full</a> of complaints about scratches right out of the box. There are also plenty of reports about <a target="_blank" href="http://gizmodo.com/5945818/what-is-the-weird-rattle-in-these-brand-new-iphone-5s">loose batteries</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/21/iphone-5-screen-problems/">bad screens</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://discussions.apple.com/message/19754189#19754189">other</a> issues.</p>
<p>We already know that something is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/foxconn-riot-in-china-unlikely-to-be-the-last-experts-say/2012/09/25/1e6828b8-071c-11e2-afff-d6c7f20a83bf_story.html">rotten in the land of Foxconn</a>, so it&#8217;s hard not to wonder if some of these issues aren&#8217;t starting to affect Apple&#8217;s ability to produce its phones with the quality we&#8217;ve come to expect.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m off to see the geniuses at my local Apple store. Let&#8217;s see what they have to say.</p>
