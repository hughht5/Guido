Bigfoot, lost-city-of-Atlantis, unicorn style legend. But no more &mdash; the iPad mini is finally real, as CEO Tim Cook has unveiled the slightly smaller Apple tablet on stage. </p>
<p>No reason to delay the deets any more than they already have been. Here&#8217;s the story: </p>
<h2>Specs</h2>
<h3>Dimensions:</h3>
<ul>
<li>7.2mm thin</li>
<li>53 percent lighter</li>
<li>.68 pounds</li>
</ul>
<h3>Design:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Thinner bezels</li>
<li>Ultra rounded edges</li>
<li>Updated smart covers</li>
<li>White and Black models</li>
<li>Of course, a unibody design</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some Thoughts:</strong> We expected a pretty huge design refresh. Jony Ive said in the video that there is inherent loss in just shrinking a product. </p>
<h3>Display:</h3>
<ul>
<li>7.9-inches</li>
<li>LCD</li>
<li>1,024 x 768 resolution</li>
<li>All software for original iPad works on iPad mini because they share the same screen resolution.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some Thoughts:</strong><br />
Phil Schiller pit the iPad mini against the Nexus 7 on stage, and showed that the display is actually 49 percent larger in portrait, and 67 percent larger in landscape. </p>
<p>That has to do with a new design that makes the bezels much smaller than we&#8217;ve seen on the larger iPad models. Schiller showed off Yelp!, eBay and Pandora apps on both tablets, showing the difference between apps developed specifically for a tablet as opposed to apps that have been stretched from a smartphone. </p>
<h3>Guts</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dual-core A5</li>
<li>Lightning dock</li>
<li>10 hours of battery life</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the parts you&#8217;re seeing above are included in the iPhone 4S. They&#8217;re components that Apple has already been sourcing from various manufacturers, meaning they&#8217;re much easier to procure this time around. By retooling the same components for the iPad Mini, Apple is likely cutting costs. </p>
<h3>Connectivity</h3>
<ul>
<li>Wifi</li>
<li>3G wireless</li>
<li>4G LTE wireless</li>
</ul>
<h3>Camera</h3>
<ul>
<li>5-megapixel camera</li>
<li>FaceTime HD front-facing camera</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some Thoughts:</strong></p>
<p>The iPad isn&#8217;t great for taking pictures. It&#8217;s just too big. But the iPad Mini will be even more portable than its big brother, and perhaps a bit more wieldy, too. The new iPod touch is clearly trying to replace the average digital point-and-shoot camera, and the iPad mini is to the iPad as the iPod touch is to the iPhone 5. </p>
<p>Attention to camera capabilities may be a nice counter to the lower-grade specs. </p>
