<p>The app actually <a target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/29/chefs-feed-launches_n_987471.html">launched about a year ago</a>, but today the company is unveiling version 2.0 of its iOS app, with updated social features. Co-founders Steve and Jared Rivera (the CEO and CMO, respectively, and yes, they&#8217;re brothers) gave me a demo of the new app, and also the old one to illustrate the difference. The previous version of Chefs Feed was mostly limited to browsing different recommendations. The update, however, is much more social. You&#8217;re not just looking at dishes recommended by chefs, but you can also &#8220;follow&#8221; them to receive their updates — not only what they&#8217;re eating, but also what&#8217;s new and unique at their own restaurants. Users also get their own social profiles, where they track dishes they&#8217;ve already eaten and build an itinerary of dishes that they want to eat in the future.</p>
<p>There are now nearly 600 chefs in the system, the Riveras say, including the French Laundry&#8217;s Thomas Keller, Spago&#8217;s Wolfgang Puck, and Babbo&#8217;s Mario Batali. With the growing interest in celebrity chefs and chef culture, the Riveras say most chefs take intense pride in their profiles and recommendations. That should only increase with the new following feature, and version 2.0 makes it&#8217; even easier for those chefs to add dishes to the system — instead of sending their recommendations to the Chefs Feed team, they can just post updates from the app itself (although the team is still fact-checking each update).</p>
<p>One thing I wondered about the model — it seems like a great idea in a city like New York, where there are lots of professional chefs who can introduce content to the system, but does it really work in other locations? Steve Rivera argues that even in cities with fewer chefs using the app, Chefs Feed still has something to offer. Austin, for example, has a relatively small number of dish recommendations (about 200), but Rivera says, &#8220;Two hundred dishes can keep users happy for a long time.&#8221; </p>
<p>He also admits that not every participating chef is as active as the others, but he says the company can work with different levels of engagement. If some chefs want to add new dishes every day, well, the new app accommodates that. If others don&#8217;t have the time or inclination for that kind of activity, the company will still reach out every once in a while to ask for new recommendations.</p>
<p>As for making money, Steve Rivera says, &#8220;We think this thing going into a media property, and we&#8217;re going to monetize all the traditional ways media company would.&#8221; In fact, Chefs Feed seems to have a pretty good start on that front, having provided short video documentaries that were shown Virgin America flights. There&#8217;s also a book and a pilot for a TV show in the works, the Riveras say.</p>
