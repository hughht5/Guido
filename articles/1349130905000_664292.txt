<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/01/nuances-nina-brings-voice-activated-search-to-officedrops-document-management-service/officedropsearch-jpeg/" rel="attachment wp-att-664516"></a>In the new version of the iOS app, OfficeDrop connects to Nina that then sends back the result. Nina listens to the request, understand the semantics, and correlates to what you have in your files. OfficeDrop&#8217;s Healy Jones says down the line the company sees using Nina to command a camera to take a scan.</p>
<p>Nina, which stands for Nuance Interactive Natural Assistant, uses speech recognition technologies and voice biometrics to identify a user. It has an understanding of natural language and the user’s intent to “deliver an interactive user experience that not only understands what is said, but also can identify who is saying it.” It is meant for the enterprise market with use cases in customer service and IT support. </p>
<p>In a recent blog post, <a target="_blank" href="http://opusresearch.net/wordpress/2012/08/05/nuance-debuts-nina-speech-enabled-virtual-assistance-for-mobile-customer-care/">Opus Research&#8217;s Dan Miller writes</a> that applications developers can tailor the Nina experience to fit specific business requirements. For instance, insurance and financial services specialist, USAA, will put Nina into service as an assistant to its increasingly mobile roster of military veterans and active service personnel.</p>
<p>The Nina SDK is available for download. Apple Siri, on the other hand, remains locked down. A Siri app is not expected any time soon.</p>
<p>By integrating Nina, OfficeDrip becomes one of very few companies in the market to use voice search But the market should open up considerably. Miller writes there are now more than two dozen firms aiming to compete in the virtual assistant market. These are companies such as VirtuOZ, Anboto, NextIT, Expert Systems, Artificial Solutions and VoiceBox. These companies &#8220;leverage expertise in customer care analytics, artificial intelligence or automated chat with an eye on revolutionizing self-service with virtual personal assistance.&#8221;</p>
<p>The market will change considerably over the next few years as voice becomes more deeply embedded into mobile apps. If it can stay ahead of the pack, OfficeDrop could establish itself as one of the most sophisticated apps in the business market.</p>
