In recent times, major players Apple (<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/apple-releases-a-totally-redesigned-itunes-with-icloud-built-in/" title="Apple Releases A Totally Redesigned iTunes With iCloud Built-In">iCloud</a>), Google (Drive), and Amazon (<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/31/amazon-updates-cloud-player-scan-match-imports-256-kbps-audio-upgrades-premium-accounts/" title="Amazon Updates Cloud Player: Scan &amp; Match Imports, 256 Kbps Audio Upgrades, Premium Accounts">Cloud</a>), have pitched up alongside early pioneers in the music locker and streaming space, such as Michael Robertson&#8217;s <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/12/mp3tunes-buy-anywhere-listen-everywhere/">MP3tunes</a>. And, perhaps feeling the heat, another burgeoning offering &#8212; <a target="_blank" href="http://AudioBox.fm">AudioBox.fm</a> &#8212; has seen a significant reboot with an approach that appears to &#8216;bring everything but the kitchen sink&#8217; to the cloud-music table.</p>
<p>At the heart of this completely rewritten version of AudioBox is integration to a plethora of third-party cloud storage services and a desktop app to stream directly from a user&#8217;s own computer &#8212; all built around a slick HTML5 browser-based music player.</p>
<p>In addition to being able to sync and access tracks stored on a user&#8217;s Dropbox, Skydrive, Google Drive, or Box.net account, among others (a feature AudioBox dubs &#8216;Unified Library&#8217;), the service provides cloud-storage of its own on a &#8216;pay as you grow&#8217;-basis or through dedicated subscription tiers for those users that know more about their requirements in advance.</p>
<p>Streaming from YouTube and SoundCloud is also supported.</p>
<p>Alternatively, users can shun the cloud altogether, turning their own computer into a private music locker via AudioBox Desktop &#8211; an app they download that means their locally stored music collection can stream through the AudioBox player just as if it <em>was</em> in the cloud. It&#8217;s a feature we&#8217;ve seen offered elsewhere, though AudioBox stresses that it&#8217;s worked hard to do this in a secure manner, without the need for a user to open up any additional router/modem ports, and notes that the feature is a great way to &#8220;circumvent&#8221; the walls of Apple&#8217;s iTunes.</p>
<p>As you&#8217;d expect of any modern music player software, AudioBox supports playlists and rule-based smart playlists. There&#8217;s plenty of social media integration too. Tie-ins exist for Last.fm, Twitter, Facebook, Twitch.TV, Google+ and others, so a user can spam their friends with what music they are currently listening to, as well as track their own listening habits.</p>
<p>And as exhaustive a list this is, I&#8217;ve undoubtedly missed off a fair few features (such as support for Apple&#8217;s Retina display). Which begs the question: Is this &#8216;bring everything but the kitchen sink&#8217; approach enough to compete with larger players, such as Apple, Amazon, Google et. al.? That&#8217;s probably best left answered by the market, but either way, AudioBox&#8217;s functionality and ambition is impressive.</p>
<p>The are, however, holes that still need to be filled. Missing (for now) are native mobile apps for this rewritten version of the service &#8212; though I&#8217;m told that iOS, Android, and BlackBerry 10 apps are in the current pipeline, possibly just a few weeks away. There&#8217;s also an API, so third-party developers can fill any further gaps, though don&#8217;t rule out AudioBox getting there first if the current box of tricks &#8212; to use a different metaphor &#8212; is anything to go by.</p>
<p>To that end, the startup behind AudioBox &#8212; iCoreTech &#8212; has upped <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/26/audiobox-fm-hits-iphone-lets-you-stream-your-music-collection-from-the-cloud/">roots</a> from its native Italy to incorporate in the U.S. and is now headquartered in New York, after securing $25K in angel funding. Meanwhile, TechCrunch has learned that the company is in late stage talks with a U.S. ISP and several other companies, including an online music store, about licensing its platform.</p>
