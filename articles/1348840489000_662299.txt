The company remains in the invidious position of having to flog an out-of-date OS (BB7) while it tries to get its next-gen OS, BB10, ready for lift off at the start of next year. The wait for BB10 devices goes on &#8212; but two of RIM&#8217;s forthcoming BB10 phones have surfaced online in what appears to be an internal marketing video <a target="_blank" href="http://vimeo.com/user1927498">posted to Vimeo</a> (but since taken down &#8212; NB: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.slashgear.com/blackberry-10-demo-video-gives-first-glimpse-of-qwerty-hero-device-27249563/">Slashgear</a> still has the video).</p>
<p>The video was spotted by BlackBerry fan site <a target="_blank" href="http://crackberry.com/leaked-images-qwerty-blackberry-10-n-series-appear-online">Crackberry.com</a> which snagged a few screengrabs before the video was taken down. There are two devices depicted: one fully touchscreen BlackBerry (the L series) and one traditional Qwerty-packing option for BlackBerry keyboard fans (the N series).</p>

<p>The video doesn&#8217;t focus on the specs of the forthcoming phones but discusses how they might be marketed &#8212; positing the idea that <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ladygaga">Lady Gaga</a> could be among a group of celebrities (and &#8216;non celebrities&#8217;) who will be given one of the BB10 devices for 24 hours to use it to create or document something before passing the device on to the next person. &#8220;A new track in a single day&#8221; in Gaga&#8217;s case.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not entirely clear whether RIM has already &#8216;reached out&#8217; to Gaga &#8212; or whether the video is indulging in some serious wishful thinking, bearing in mind the list of name-checked celebrities also includes kids book-seller extraordinaire, JK Rowling, and film maker Ridley Scott.  We&#8217;ve reached out to RIM to see if it will confirm or disown the video and will update with any response.</p>
<p>Over the course of its three minutes and 22 seconds, the video shows off various previously demoed BB10 features including a photo editing feature that lets you time-shift your shots to achieve a snap with perfect expressions, and the new predictive typing software keyboard that floats suggested words above keys within the keyboard so they&#8217;re easier to tap on.</p>
<p>And as one eagle-eyed TC editor noted, it also shows the BB10 devices apparently using a font that&#8217;s <em>very reminiscent</em> of the old Palm OS Font&#8230;</p>
