Google joins a long list of tech companies that have a history of breaking their tradition of industry-specific policy advocacy to promote gay rights.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple views this as a civil rights issue, rather than just a political issue,&#8221; <a target="_blank" href="http://gizmodo.com/5604749/the-tech-companies-that-helped-fight-proposition-8">wrote</a> Apple before California&#8217;s controversial approval of Proposition 8 to ban gay marriage. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos <a target="_blank" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2012/07/27/jeff-bezos-joins-growing-list-of-billionaires-backing-same-sex-marriage/">contributed</a> a sizable 2.5 million to the cause of marriage equality and Bill Gates chipped in 100k.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not generally take a position on issues outside of our field, especially not social issues,&#8221; wrote Google Co-Founder Sergey Brin, &#8220;we should not eliminate anyone&#8217;s fundamental rights, whatever their sexuality, to marry the person they love.&#8221;</p>
