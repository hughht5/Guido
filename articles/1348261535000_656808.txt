Being TechCrunch&#8217;s only remaining intern, we had him brave the New York City night and blog from the iPhone 5 line. He did it like a champ. And now he&#8217;s sleeping. In his Aol cubicle.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s <a href="http://techcrunch.com/author/romain-dillet/">a grown man</a> — a 22-year old Frenchman who&#8217;s braved multiple big cities on his very own — but I couldn&#8217;t help but worry about him the whole time. But lo and behold, here he is, sleeping like a baby.</p>
<p>And we&#8217;re glad to see it.</p>
<p>As you very well know, we&#8217;ve covered the iPhone 5 NYC launch to its fullest extent, with <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/21/watch-it-live-apple-opens-doors-to-its-nyc-flagship-store-for-iphone-5-launch/">a live stream</a> of the doors opening, a report on <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/20/in-line-for-the-iphone-5-where-have-all-the-fanbois-gone/">the lack of fanboys</a> in line, a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/21/the-iphone-5-has-arrived-but-which-iphone-is-the-best-value/">guide to getting the best value</a> for your purchase, and updates from the line itself. Yes, from Romain.</p>
<p>He explored the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/20/in-line-for-the-iphone-5-occupyapple-is-occupying-the-line-to-sell-their-spots/">#OccupyApple movement</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/20/in-line-for-the-iphone-5-as-the-craze-of-the-day-settles-down-neighbors-share-line-experiences/">shared stories</a> with his neighbors in line, and had <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/21/in-line-for-the-iphone-5-all-of-this-for-a-phone/">a moment of unrest</a> around 4am. And as he slumbers peacefully, his beautiful iPhone 5 sits beside him.</p>
<p>So, as any good intern should expect, we stole it and took a panorama shot of him.</p>
