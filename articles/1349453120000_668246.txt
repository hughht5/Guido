<p>The company was founded by tech blogger Marshall Kirkpatrick — he&#8217;s best-known for his long stint at ReadWriteWeb, but he was also <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchnotes.com/2006/11/27/changes-at-techcrunch/">an early TechCrunch writer</a>. He <a target="_blank" href="http://allthingsd.com/20111111/tech-blogger-starts-a-company-around-his-data-mining-aka-web-stalking-skills/">left his full-time role at RWW last November</a> to start his own company, which he called Plexus Engine. He&#8217;s launching the company on-stage at the Portland Incubator Experiment from agency Wieden+Kennedy, and with W+K&#8217;s help, he&#8217;s given the company a new, less wonky-sounding name.</p>
<p>To create a report in Little Bird, you just type a topic into the search box, whether it&#8217;s startups, comic books, or beer (to pick three examples that are near and dear to my heart). Then you can either identify five experts on the topic who represent the kind of influencer you&#8217;re trying to reach, or Little Bird can provide the initial list and you can edit it to match what you&#8217;re looking for. Once you&#8217;ve selected those first five experts, the service looks at its social data and creates a big list of similar influencers.</p>

<p>Kirkpatrick says that behind the scenes, Little Bird isn&#8217;t doing any kind of content analysis. Instead, it&#8217;s looking purely at the relationships between users. making a list of &#8220;topic insiders&#8221;, based on their connections with the initial accounts that you provided. That means Little Bird doesn&#8217;t need to understand anything about startups, or comic books, or beer, and it should be able to create an influencer list around any topic — Kirkpatrick says the only exceptions are subjects that are so arcane and specific that there&#8217;s no core group of influencers on social networks.</p>
<p>Little Bird also allows customers to examine the influencer data in several ways. You can see the insiders who have the highest number of total followers, or the insiders who are most-followed by other insiders (in startups, that&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/techcrunch/">TechCrunch</a>). You can also search for an individual account and see how influential they are in a given topic. And there are engagement tools to help you start conversations with those influencers.</p>
<p>Until now, the company has been in a pilot test, but it&#8217;s launching more widely today. It&#8217;s also expanding its social data from Twitter to LinkedIn, with plans to add Google+ and academic citations soon.</p>
<p>Little Bird has raised $1 million raised in angel funding led by Mark Cuban&#8217;s Radical Investments, with participation from Howard Lindzon&#8217;s Social Leverage Group, Hubspot co-founder Dharmesh Shah, and Blaine Cook, an early engineer at Twitter.</p>
