The company has also hit the 1 million members mark. You can download the iPad app <a target="_blank" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sneakpeeq/id552622065">here.</a></p>
<p>The startup aims to replicate the experience of shopping for items in a retail store with a social twist. Similar to the way you flip over a price tag to look at the cost of an item at a store, Sneakpeeq doesn&#8217;t tell you the price instantly when you visit a product&#8217;s landing page. You click a &#8220;Peeq&#8221; button to find the price. The site features daily boutiques that offer discounts on clothes, shoes, home accessories, and more from 1,000-plus brands from well-known names like Kate Spade and Puma to smaller designers and purveyors.</p>
<p>Sneakpeeq incentivizes engagement by turning user actions into discounts. By Peeqing, buying, sharing items on Facebook, and more, you earn badges on Sneakpeeq, which can then be applied for discounts on any items. Each boutique has a leaderboard where fans can compete by Peeqing, sharing, and buying products. Additionally, every member on Sneakpeeq builds a discovery profile through Peeqing, sharing and buying things. Users can also see who shares common interests in various product categories including Taste (gourmet foods), Living (home), and Style (fashion and accessories).</p>
<p>The new iPad app marries this gamified, personalized approach to e-commerce with the device&#8217;s visual appeal. The app features Sneakpeeq products front and center with large images; rewards customer interaction with badges offering discounts, free shipping, and other perks; and integrates with Facebook and other social networks to encourage and reward the act of sharing products and purchases with friends.</p>
<p>It also features a swipe-activated magazine layout, with infinite scrolling among boutiques and products, as well as a “personalized mall” that customizes each user’s Sneakpeeq shopping experience based on past interactions on sneakpeeq. The more an individual interacts with the app and Sneakpeeq’s boutiques, the more relevant and personalized the entire shopping experience becomes.</p>
<p>Founder Henry Kim tells us that the reason the company debuted an iPad app first is because he was seeing more traffic coming to the Sneakpeeq site from the iPad than any other mobile device.</p>
<p>Sneakpeeq has raised <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/29/firstmark-capital-leads-7-5m-round-in-social-shopping-startup-sneakpeeq/">over $10 million</a> in funding to date.</p>
