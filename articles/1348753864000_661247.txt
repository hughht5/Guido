<p>Well, here in the U.S. we still don&#8217;t have anything more than rumors to go on, but Nokia&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nokia.com/ru-ru/about-nokia/press/windows8-preorder">Russian</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://presse.nokia.de/2012/09/27/nokia-bringt-lumia-920-und-lumia-820-im-november-nach-deutschland/">German</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nokia.com/it-it/nokia/stampa/comunicati-stampa/comunicati-stampa/">Italian</a> arms have begun to reveal their pricing and availability plans.</p>
<p>Lumia devotees in Germany and Italy can rest easy knowing that Nokia&#8217;s latest Windows Phones will be available to them starting in November, and the entry-level Lumia 820 will cost €499 ($642) in either market. The flagship Lumia 920 on the other hand will run Germans €649 ($835), but those lucky Italians will be able to score the device for just a bit less &#8212; €599 ($771), to be precise.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nokia is still keeping a few key details under wraps when it comes Russia. The truly ambitious can pre-order their Lumia hardware starting today &#8212; the 920 will set Russian consumers back 24,990 rubles ($803), while the 820 will cost 19,990 rubles ($642)&#8211; but all Nokia would admit in its Russia statement is that the device will launch sometime in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Expect this first slew of announcements to be followed by plenty more in short order. It wouldn&#8217;t be a surprise to see a U.K. announcement sooner instead of later, and a few other far-flung carriers like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/15/nokia-to-produce-lumia-920-with-td-scdma-for-china-mobile/">China Mobile</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/27/nokia-lumia-australian-carriers/">Australia&#8217;s Telstra</a> have already confirmed that they would carry the Lumia 920 so their launch details are likely being ironed out as we speak.</p>
