Apple’s Phil Schiller has just officially announced the new iPhone 5 at the company’s massive press event here in San Francisco, less than a year since its predecessor was unveiled.</p>
<p>Some of the news won’t come as much of a shock considering the sheer volume of rumors and leaks lately (even<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/whoops-apple-search-engine-is-revealing-product-news-before-todays-event-iphone-5-new-ipods-new-itunes-confirmed/"> Apple let some details slip</a> earlier today) &#8212; I’m going to resist the temptation to pontificate on every new feature as it&#8217;s revealed (for now, anyway), so let’s get right down to it.</p>
<h4>The iPhone 5</h4>
<ul>
<li>We can finally put the debate to rest — Apple’s newest mobile juggernaut is called the iPhone 5 (despite actually being the sixth iPhone to hit the market). It&#8217;s 20% lighter than the iPhone 4S, 18% thinner, and crafted out of (what else?) glass and aluminum.</li>
<li>The long-rumored (and handsome) two-toned design is indeed legitimate, as is the new iPhone’s larger<strong> 4-inch Retina Display.</strong> And yes, that display runs at 1136 by 640. According to Schiller, it&#8217;s &#8220;the most accurate display in the industry&#8221; because the touch sensors are embedded in the display as well.</li>
<li>It’s hardly a surprise at this point, but the iPhone 5 packs support for Sprint, Verizon, and AT&amp;T&#8217;s <strong>LTE networks</strong> here in the States.</li>
<li>As expected, Apple has also unveiled a brand new chipset for the iPhone 5:<strong> the A6</strong>, which Schiller says is a full two times faster than the A5 chip in the iPhone 4S</li>
<li>The iPhone 4S&#8217;s battery life wasn&#8217;t anything to write home about, but the iPhone 5 seems equipped to do much better &#8212; 8 hours of 3G talk time, as well as 8 hours of 3G and LTE web browsing to be precise.</li>
<li>The iPhone’s audio system has been bolstered with a smaller (but improved speaker). There are also now three microphones in the mix: one on the front, one on the back, and another on the bottom.</li>
<li>That oft-rumored miniature Dock Connector is real, and it&#8217;s called &#8220;Lightning.&#8221; Yes, there&#8217;s an adapter for it, but no word yet on exactly what it will cost you </li>
</ul>

<h4>Camera</h4>
<ul>
<li>Smartphone cameras are really starting to give their point-and-shoot brethren a run for their money (think Nokia’s PureView and HTC’s ImageSense tech), but instead of running up the megapixel count, Apple has stuck with an <strong>8-megapixel camera</strong>. That said, the backside-illuminated sensor is smaller, and features much better low-light performance (finally!).</li>
<li>App developers may be bummed to know that the camera now also has a built-in panorama mode. The revamped camera also supports 1080p video capture, and users can now snap photos while recording video at the same time. I wonder how HTC feels about that.</li>
<li>Despite what a handful of leaks pointed to in the weeks leading up to the event, there&#8217;s been no mention of an integrated NFC chip yet.</li>
</ul>
