It will be offering 4,500,000 shares, pricing them between $13-15, the document revealed today. But while initially the company had planned to raise up to $115 million &#8212; as noted in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1549346/000104746912005905/a2209364zs-1.htm">documents</a> filed days before Facebook went public &#8212; today it appeared to be singing a different tune. With shares priced at $14, &#8220;We estimate that the net proceeds to us from this offering will be approximately $54.2 million.&#8221; In other words, about half of the originally intended amount.</p>
<p>It also notes that it has granted the underwriters the right to purchase up to 675,000 additional shares of common stock to cover over-allotments.</p>
<p>To date, Shutterstock has seen 250 million paid downloads of 20 million images in its photo library, used in publishing books, eBooks, magazines and news articles. Its active users are spread across 150 countries and its 35,000-plus contributors are on average uploading over 10,000 photos every day, with some 550,000 paying customers, paying on average $2 per image.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t give current revenue figures in the S-1 but notes that in 2011 revenues were $120 million.</p>
<p>More to come.</p>
