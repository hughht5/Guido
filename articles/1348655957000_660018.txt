It also plans to use the funds to develop new products.</p>
<p>The Series E round was led by existing investors August Capital, Canaan Partners, InterWest Partners, QuestMark Partners, and US Venture Partners.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this newest round of funding, we are able to develop new markets in Europe and Asia Pacific,&#8221; said Shane Buckley, CEO of Xirrus, in a statement. &#8220;We are 100% focused on extending our leadership in delivering wired performance for the new age of wireless-based BYOD and rich-media applications.&#8221;</p>
<p>Xirrus believes it&#8217;s well placed to take advantage of the BYOD (bring your own device) trend that&#8217;s driving demand for mobile devices and apps in businesses &#8212; thereby increasing the need for robust and secure enterprise Wi-Fi networks capable of dealing with the device influx.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s technology includes <a target="_blank" href="http://www.xirrus.com/products/wireless-arrays.aspx">Wi-Fi Arrays</a> that each include between two and 16 radios, a high-gain directional antenna, onboard multi-gigabit switch, controller, firewall, threat sensor and a spectrum analyzer to improve coverage and performance.</p>
<p>Xirrus claims its kit supports up to four times more coverage, and eight times more bandwidth and capacity than &#8220;conventional AP technology&#8221;. The result? Souped up wireless networks capable of providing businesses with wire-like performance.</p>
<p>&#8220;The global enterprise market for WLAN continues to see double digit growth as organizations grapple with the reality that wireless is becoming the defacto access layer,&#8221; said Steve Krausz, General Partner at US Venture Partners, in a supporting statement. &#8221;Xirrus, with its innovative Wireless Array technology and rapidly growing partner programs, is well positioned to lead the industry as it evolves from wired to wireless access.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wireless has gone from being a &#8216;nice to have&#8217; overlay technology to the primary connection,&#8221; added Zeus Karravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research, in a statement. &#8220;Wireless networks can be every bit as fast and secure as wired networks. But IT leaders must be laser focused on delivering the needed performance that gives users a rock-solid wireless experience.&#8221;</p>
