The investment comes just eight months after the site has launched. As is usual with investments in Rocket Internet companies, the company is not officially disclosing the terms of the deal but someone close to the company tells me the value is in the &#8220;significant double digit millions&#8221; of dollars, on a company that is apparently making double-digit millions of dollars in annualized revenue.</p>
<p>A look at past investments might give a clue to what kind of ballpark we are talking about: This deal makes this the sixth investment made in a Rocket Internet company by JP Morgan in the space of a month. </p>
<p>In addition to the $40-80 million in Lamoda, it also made an <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/16/zalando-the-samwer-zappos-clone-closes-another-round-adds-jp-morgan-quadrant-capital-as-backers/">undisclosed investment in Europe&#8217;s Zalando</a> and a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.altonivel.com.mx/23109-jp-morgan-invertira-en-tienda-online-brasilena.html">$45 million investment in Brazil&#8217;s Dafiti</a>. And it also, just days ago, also invested in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zando.co.za">Zando</a> in South Africa, in a deal <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bdlive.co.za/businesstimes/2012/09/23/jp-morgan-invests-in-local-online-shop-zando">believed to be</a> in the &#8220;three digit million rand&#8221; ballpark &#8212; or &#8220;tens of millions of dollars&#8221; to those who think in U.S. currency. In Asia, earlier this month JP Morgan <a target="_blank" href="http://en.dailysocial.net/post/breaking-jp-morgan-to-invest-heavily-in-rocket-internets-e-commerce-startup-lazada">reportedly also invested in Lazada</a>.</p>
<p>The news comes as another Samwer/Rocket venture gathers some momentum: the European Square competitor <a target="_blank" href="http://www.payleven.de">Payleven</a> has released an API for its mobile payment service, similar to what iZettle is offering to merchants and developers to integrate its platform into their own apps, and has expanded operations into Italy.</p>
<p>According to the announcement issued today, JP Morgan is investing across all of Zalora&#8217;s footprint, which covers Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam, which collectively have a potential market of 500 million users.</p>
<p>In addition to JP Morgan and Rocket Internet, other investors in Zalora include Summit Partners and Invus. Zalora says it employs some 1,000 people. In JP Morgan&#8217;s Lamoda investment the company got cash-for-equity in the deal, but it&#8217;s not clear whether it is getting the same this time around.</p>
<p>So what to make of this relentless global expansion by the Samwer brothers? Well, if you think about the business model behind many of the world&#8217;s most successful e-commerce sites, they are all about achieving economies of scale. This is basically what is driving the Samwer brothers&#8217; move to expand their fashion/shoe business to more and more markets. As these sites grow, they can collectively become a stronger buyer from fashion/shoe suppliers, keeping their costs down and improving margins in the process. And given that they have proven to be adept at creating exits for these operations &#8212; Groupon having acquired CityDeal, and eBay acquiring Alando some years ago to spearhead its international expansion &#8212; JP Morgan clearly is interested in getting in on the action.</p>
<p>But that does not mean all is smooth sailing for Rocket Internet or Zalora. Just as Rocket Internet has had a tricky time in Russia, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/22/in-confidential-email-samwer-describes-online-furniture-strategy-as-a-blitzkrieg/">specifically in the early days</a>, there have been reports hinting a similarly choppy situation at Zalora. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.techinasia.com/zalora-pressure-oliver-samwer-singapore/">TechInAsia</a> reported in April, just a month after the Zalora launched, that Oliver Samwer made a visit to the company&#8217;s HQ for a little staff motivation. Rocket Internet <a target="_blank" href="http://sgentrepreneurs.com/2012/04/18/rocket-internets-zalora-denies-theyre-in-bad-shape-oliver-samwers-visit-routine/">denied</a> any problems at the time.</p>
