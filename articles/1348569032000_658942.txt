As is usual with investments in Rocket Internet companies, the company is not officially disclosing the terms of the deal.</p>
<p>But a look at past investments might give a clue to what kind of ballpark we are talking about: This deal makes this the fourth investment made in a Rocket Internet company by JP Morgan in the space of a month. In addition to the $40-80 million in Lamoda, it also made an <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/16/zalando-the-samwer-zappos-clone-closes-another-round-adds-jp-morgan-quadrant-capital-as-backers/">undisclosed investment in Europe&#8217;s Zalando</a> and a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.altonivel.com.mx/23109-jp-morgan-invertira-en-tienda-online-brasilena.html">$45 million investment in Brazil&#8217;s Dafiti</a>.</p>
<p>The news comes as another Samwer/Rocket venture gathers some momentum: the European Square competitor Payleven has released an API for its mobile payment service and has expanded operations into Italy.</p>
<p>According to the announcement issued today, JP Morgan is investing across all of Zalora&#8217;s footprint, which covers Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam, which collectively have a potential market of 500 million users.</p>
<p>In addition to JP Morgan and Rocket Internet, other investors in Zalora include Summit Partners and Invus.</p>
