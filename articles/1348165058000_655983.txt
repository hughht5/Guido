<p>As you should already know, the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/18/iphone-5-review/">iPhone 5</a> is upon us. The phone goes on sale tomorrow morning, with doors opening at 8am Eastern Time. There are already a few dozen people in line at New York&#8217;s 5th Avenue flagship store, and by tomorrow morning, there will be several hundred.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s one intrepid young man in that line that I&#8217;d like you to meet. You may have heard of him before. His name is <a href="http://techcrunch.com/author/romain-dillet/">Romain Dillet</a>, and he&#8217;s a writer here at TechCrunch.</p>
<p>He has known he wanted an iPhone 5, and decided earlier in the week to stand in line. We, in turn, hooked him up with a camera, WiFi, plenty of batteries, and a nice, foldable chair. With the aid of the aforementioned gear, Romain will be bringing you the news himself, for 24 hours before doors open.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s been there since 9am, and aside from a MacBook crash, it&#8217;s been mostly smooth sailing. But he can tell you himself, and will, in the following series. He&#8217;ll be updating you periodically with video blogs and posts direct from the front lines.</p>
<p>The weather seems fine now, and there isn&#8217;t too much commotion, aside from the occasional reporter or curious passerby, but there&#8217;s another group waiting in line that may cause a bit of drama as the night creeps up: Occupy Wall Street, in the flesh, is in line for the iPhone 5. Not to buy it, of course, but to sell their spots.</p>
<p>In any case, stay tuned for reports from Romain, our fearless, iPhone-loving vlogger. And wish him luck, he&#8217;ll be in the streets of New York all night.</p>
<p>Be sure to catch our livestream of the doors opening starting tomorrow at 7am Eastern Time.</p>
