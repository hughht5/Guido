Needless to say, I found this to be a bit unsettling, as I instantly imagined other companies forcing this into their own job applications.</p>
<p>Whether you agree with what Klout does or not, and for the most part, I don&#8217;t, it&#8217;s a hot space. I&#8217;m not a fan of &#8220;class systems&#8221; and people feeling good or bad about some arbitrary score.  </p>
<p>As soon as my post was published, Klout&#8217;s CEO, Joe Fernandez, tweeted to me about how HR people are using Klout at companies. I asked him to come to our office and discuss it with me, and he graciously accepted. I also got to ask him about the rumors that the company had manually adjusted scores for people who complained loudly that theirs was too low.</p>
<p>Have a watch:</p>

<p>Klout is most certainly a lightning rod, and at least Fernandez isn&#8217;t backing down from a good argument or discussion.</p>
