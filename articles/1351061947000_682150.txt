I mean, it was actually great, but it sure seemed to suck at the time. We were getting <a target="_blank" href="http://crunchfund.com">CrunchFund</a> off the ground and I think everyone thought we were going to do that in full conjunction with Aol — they were and are the largest limited partner of the fund, after all.</p>
<p>Instead all hell broke loose.</p>
<p>You know the story. And this is now the fourth goddamn post on TechCrunch about TechCrunch today. But hey, at least it’s not another Apple story, right? RIGHT?!</p>
<p>Anyway, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/23/getting-the-band-back-together/">as you’ve read</a>, both Michael Arrington and myself are <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/23/nunca-podras-irte/">coming back</a> to TechCrunch. I’m extremely excited about this. No, things won’t be exactly the same as they were a few years ago. But they never are. They can’t be. They shouldn’t be. It’s about moving forward. That’s exciting.</p>
<p>But wait, I never left in the first place, right? Sort of. I cut a last-minute deal on my way out the door to keep up the Apple beat here and there, but it was never truly thought-through. I wasn’t gone, but I was falling. Like Gandalf chasing the Balrog from underneath Moria to the peak of Zirakzigil, I would eventually die.</p>
<p>And then come back.</p>
<p>So now the plan is to write about whatever I want. Most of the time that will still probably be about Apple — they are the most important tech company on the planet, after all. But I’d be lying if I didn’t say it was a challenge at times this past year to write a column that <em>had</em> to be about Apple is some capacity — even if it was only in the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/21/i-need-to-use-the-word-apple/">URL slug</a> a time or two.</p>
<p>But aren’t Michael and I horribly conflicted? Yeah. So? Who isn’t in some way? It should be about transparency, not some weird form of supression.</p>
<p>But, but, but, but we’re <em>financially</em> conflicted! That’s worse! Here’s the thing: I don’t intend to write about our startups on TechCrunch. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/23/paid-blogger/">Neither does Michael</a>. That was never the plan. Quite frankly, as a reader, I hate it when investors pull some of the masturbatory shit about their companies over and over and over again. See: Twitter, everyday. See also, the phrase: &#8220;killing it&#8221;.</p>
<p>It’s all about trust. You have to trust that I’m writing something because I believe it, not because something you don’t care about needs publicity on TechCrunch. As an investor, that can be a bit of a gray area because you can always fall back on: “well I wouldn’t have invested if I didn’t like the company” — something I use quite often, because it’s true. That’s why we believe it’s best to keep stories written by us specifically about our portfolio companies off of TechCrunch. This site has a huge audience that obviously just isn’t mine — or even just Michael’s anymore. The audiences on our own blogs are ours. That’s the better place for those posts.</p>
<p>I intend to write about a variety of things, probably late at night — just like I used to do. Not all the time, but sometimes. I still do have <a target="_blank" href="http://crunchfund.com">that day job</a> which is my top priority — CrunchFund is going strong one year in, &#8220;killing it,&#8221; as it were. And I&#8217;ll still maintain my other blogs which are more about <a target="_blank" href="http://parislemon.com">spreading interesting content</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://massivegreatness.com">personal blogging</a>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the thing, I&#8217;m doing this because I love writing about technology. I can&#8217;t stop, won&#8217;t stop. And I love TechCrunch. It just made sense to fully combine the two once again. To come back.</p>
<p>And yes, I just wrote this entire post and made the ridiculous Gandalf/Balrog reference just to be able to justify that title and image. It’s good to be back.</p>
