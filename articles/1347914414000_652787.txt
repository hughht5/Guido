<p>In a <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.foursquare.com/2012/09/17/find-places-faster-put-an-explore-widget-on-your-android-homescreen/">quick post today</a>, the company talked about the thoughts behind the move:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now, we’ve made finding the best stuff nearby even easier, with a quick shortcut to the Explore tab in the app that you can put right on your Android home screen.</p>
<p>The process for adding the shortcut is the same as adding any widget to your home screen: go to the widgets tab (in ‘all apps’) and long-press the ‘Explore’ icon (it looks like a green ball caught in a radar’s crosshairs!).</p>
<p>The next time you want to find that boutique your friend has been raving about or an awesome new cafe in the neighborhood, just tap your handy new Explore widget!</p></blockquote>

<p>This is pretty handy, actually, as I&#8217;ve found myself using foursquare Explore more than I&#8217;ve used services like Yelp in the past year. I find that coupling the geo-location data with tips from people who&#8217;ve been there and then adding the layer of content from my friends, be it past check-ins or if they&#8217;re nearby, to be a complete service for my needs.</p>
<p>When I want to look up a bar in San Francisco, I go to foursquare without thinking. This widget saves me a tap by sitting on my phone&#8217;s home screen. Sadly, this isn&#8217;t something you can do on iOS, but perhaps foursquare will break out the Explore piece much like Facebook has with its approach to Messenger on iOS.</p>
<p>Foursquare isn&#8217;t just a check-in app anymore, folks.</p>
