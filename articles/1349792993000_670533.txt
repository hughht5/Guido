Fine denizens of New York and the City Of Saint Francis, Microsoft beseeches you to untether your computing devices and connect to their ethereal Internet for the lofty sum of zero! Beginning today, the so called &#8220;Wi-Fidelity&#8221; service will be available in various &#8220;hot-spots&#8221; around both cities including the Wharf of the Fisherman and &#8220;Union&#8221; Squares of both cities, provided the Coppers can expunge the Fenian Brotherhood from their confines on Bloomingdale Road.</p>
<p>A company called Boingo will make many of these &#8220;hot-spots&#8221; available but, on November 1, special areas in various underground stations (or &#8220;subways&#8221;) will offer up data alongside the wisps of delicately perfumed pneumatic waste exhaled daily by those speedy conveyances. </p>
<p>The &#8220;press release&#8221; may be read at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/10/09/microsoft-backs-free-boingo-wifi-in-nyc-and-san-francisco/">magazine Engadget</a> but all the gentleman need know is that his computing device will connect wireless and for free through the Holiday, perhaps even as late as Boxing Day. All of this is done in honor of a new Micro-soft product entitled &#8220;Windows 8.&#8221; Now if only something can be done about the menace of the auto-mobile on our city streets, am I correct?</p>
<p>From the communiqu√© de presse:</p>
<div style="margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px;padding-left:15px;border-left:3px solid #ccc;font-style:italic;">As part of the holiday promotion, Microsoft&#8217;s sponsored Wi-Fi is immediately available for users of all Wi-Fi enabled devices in six Manhattan subway stations, supported by Transit Wireless&#8217; state-of-the-art network, and across Wi-Fi hotzones covering iconic San Francisco locations including Union Square, Fisherman&#8217;s Wharf, UN Plaza, the Financial District, Nob Hill and more. Microsoft will also sponsor Wi-Fi via more than 200 Manhattan hotzones, starting November 1. The Wi-Fi hotspots are part of Boingo&#8217;s Cloud Nine media platform, a global advertising network that enables brand advertisers to reach target audiences through high engagement Wi-Fi sponsorship.</p>
