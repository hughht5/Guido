Why, you ask? Because it&#8217;s a lightbulb controlled via smartphone, that&#8217;s why.</p>
<p>The product is just one day old on <a href="http://techcrunch.com/tag/Kickstarter">Kickstarter</a> and it already hit the $283,394 mark which means it&#8217;s definitely getting funded. The bulb itself costs $69.</p>
<p>What does it do and why do you need a smartphone? Well, first you can change the brightness and color of the bulb right from your phone. You can also set it to go on and off at a certain time and come on when you get home. </p>

<p>Because it&#8217;s a self-contained unit you don&#8217;t need to change your wiring. Just twist the old fellow in and fire up the app to enjoy endless color combinations and feel like you&#8217;re in a disco.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what it does:</p>
<div style="margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px;padding-left:15px;border-left:3px solid #ccc;font-style:italic;">Control your lights from anywhere<br />
Choose any brightness for a specific bulb, a room or your whole house<br />
Create the colors to match any mood or decor<br />
Get notifications such as Twitter, Facebook, Texts and more<br />
Reduce your energy consumption and save money<br />
Visualise your music with animated colors<br />
Make an impression at your next dinner party<br />
Get creative with colors and effects<br />
Create a night light for your kids<br />
Security mode when you&#8217;re on holidays<br />
Create groups of lights<br />
Robot dance like it&#8217;s 1999</div>
<p>Sadly the product isn&#8217;t shipping until March 2013 but it&#8217;s pretty cool, especially the music dance party part. I&#8217;m getting one so we can turn our bedroom into an adventure under the sea by twisting the knob over to blue then to white an then to dark red. The dark red is when the sharks come.</p>
