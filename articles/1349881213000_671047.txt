<p>Democracy just got an iPad upgrade: Citizens of San Francisco are now being greeted by campaign volunteers with tablets who can perform same-day signups through <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/19/california-and-11-states-now-allow-online-voter-registration/">California&#8217;s new online voter registration system</a>. Facebook investor Ron Conway and San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee were out registering citizens yesterday to promote the city&#8217;s new push to have the most innovative government. Earlier Tuesday, Conway&#8217;s technology advocacy group, sf.citi, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/09/twitter-founders-valley-tech-giants-launch-concept-video-to-make-sf-smarter/">released a video</a> of famous tech founders expounding all the ways in which homegrown technology could enhance government services (such as the notoriously difficult transit system).</p>
<p>Prior to California&#8217;s adoption of pure online voting, citizens who used the Internet to register to vote still had to follow through with paperwork at home. An experimental analysis of this digital-paper hybrid system found that it could actually <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/28/google-online-voter-registration-could-decrease-turnout/">slightly decrease</a> registration, so canvassers were incentivized to continue using paper many years after the digital revolution.</p>
<p>Now, with an iPad, or any other wireless device, the world is one step closer to going paperless.</p>
