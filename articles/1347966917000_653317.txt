<p>Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed but it should not be small: Slashdot brings in 3.7 million uniques per month; Sourceforge has 40 million monthly unique visitors; and Freecode brings in 500,000 a month.</p>
<p>It looks like the deal will leave Geeknet to focus solely on ThinkGeek, its e-commerce site for hipter tech-types.</p>
<p>Dice Holdings has built a business around recruitment and jobfinding sites focused on specific niches. They include the technology industry-focused <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dice.com">Dice.com</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.efinancialcareers.com/">eFinancialCareers</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.clearancejobs.com/">ClearanceJobs</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rigzone.com/">Rigzone</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.allhealthcarejobs.com/">AllHealthcareJobs</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.targetedjobfairs.com/">Targeted Job Fairs</a>, an events-focused business.</p>
<p>It looks like the acquisition of Slashdot and the rest is a play to push more traffic to these lucrative job sites &#8212; specifically for Dice.com although you can see where other sites might benefit, too.</p>
<p>More to come. Refresh for updates.</p>
