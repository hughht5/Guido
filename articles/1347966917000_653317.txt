<p>The deal is bringing Dice a set of sites that are profitable and generating good revenues: the company tells me that they are on track for a $20 million turnover this year on EBITDA of $5 million. Slashdot brings in 3.7 million uniques per month; Sourceforge has 40 million monthly unique visitors; and Freecode brings in 500,000 a month.</p>
<p>The purchase announced today was the result of a tender process started by Geeknet back in May, when it announced it was seeking strategic alternatives for the media business. And indeed it looks like the deal will leave Geeknet to focus solely on ThinkGeek, its e-commerce site for hipter tech-types.</p>
<p>Dice Holdings has built a business around recruitment and jobfinding sites focused on specific niches. They include the technology industry-focused <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dice.com">Dice.com</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.efinancialcareers.com/">eFinancialCareers</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.clearancejobs.com/">ClearanceJobs</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rigzone.com/">Rigzone</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.allhealthcarejobs.com/">AllHealthcareJobs</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.targetedjobfairs.com/">Targeted Job Fairs</a>, an events-focused business. Up to now, its purchases have been more in the area of building up this business &#8212; such as its <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/10/dice-worldwideworker/">2010 purchase of Worldwideworker</a>.</p>
<p>It looks like the acquisition of Slashdot and the rest is a play to push more traffic to these lucrative job sites &#8212; specifically for Dice.com although you can see where other sites might benefit, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dice has been talking about building content and user engagement to be top of mind and more integral to professionals doing work, and if you think about SourceForge and Slashdot, it&#8217;s about user engagement to help you do your job,&#8221; Michael Durney, SVP, finance and CFO of Dice Holdings, Inc., told me today in an interview. &#8220;We started to build on our own [content business] but here we have two sites that do it very well.</p>
<p>He tells me that the sites will very much appear just as they have done for users. &#8220;It&#8217;s not about cutting costs,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to change the experience today. What will happen over time is that the Dice.com site is will operate more seamlessly connected to these sites. But the sites themselves will keep their look and feel and will run on their own.&#8221;</p>
<p>That &#8220;absolutely&#8221; includes editorial independence, he said. &#8220;We think that&#8217;s really key. We don&#8217;t profess to add much from an editorial standpoint. We will give the user bases on our sites and those the ability to interact with each other. Our goal here is to make them part of the overall tech and engineering experience at the company.&#8221; He also hopes that Slashdot and SourceForge in particular, which each get millions of comments from their users, will also be useful to Dice for its own user engagement attempts. &#8220;One of the things we expect to learn is how these sites engage with their user bases,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Dice.com is a significantly smaller opeation in comparison to the combined force of Slashdot, SourceForge and Freecode. It has a little more than 2 million uniques per month, Durney said. The other sites have 1 million or less uniques each.</p>
<p>More to come. Refresh for updates.</p>
