In particular, when it comes to the device, he said that &#8220;everything Microsoft has done is coming together.&#8221;</p>
<p>Microsoft has brought nearly all of its brands to the Surface. It runs <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/24/clearing-up-the-confusion-its-the-new-windows-8-ui-not-metro-ui/">Windows RT</a> and comes with Xbox content stores and even the new <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/14/microsoft-xbox-music/">Xbox Music service</a>. Microsoft provides Bing-branded apps to read news and get the latest sports scores, and promotes SkyDrive all around the OS.</p>
<p>It is Microsoft&#8217;s first take on the tablet market, but a very different one from competitors as you can read in <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/23/microsoft-surface-rt-review/">Matt Burns&#8217; review</a>. The company appears to be very committed to the device and is eager to show the features of the device.</p>
<p>The emphasis of the conference is on consumption and entertainment features. Office and the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/23/surface-touch-cover-detailed-an-ultra-thin-touch-keyboard-as-efficient-as-a-laptops/">Touch Keyboard</a> are just mentioned here and there, without a proper demo.</p>
<p>Yet, the press conference is going through features we already knew. Communication is important for such an important product launch. Selling the Surface is not a small feat. Making customers understand how it works and how it&#8217;s different is key to the fate of the device.</p>
<p>Nobody can blame Microsoft for taking a bold move with the Surface — and Windows 8 in general. With that device, the company known for its softwares has designed its first PC. Marketing it will be even harder and is what&#8217;s coming next. Commenters are all waiting for to see how it will turn out.</p>
