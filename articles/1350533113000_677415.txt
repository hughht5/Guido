Actually, it&#8217;s been a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/28/color-ceo-nguyen-is-out/">crazy few months</a>. </p>
<p>But now it&#8217;s looking possible that it could be coming to a happier ending than most embattled startups can dream of. After all that&#8217;s happened, Color might still be able to say that it has been acquired by a major technology company for millions of dollars. Or, more accurately, that some of its assets have been acquired. To-may-to, to-mah-to.</p>
<p>First, some context. The famous and somewhat infamous Silicon Valley startup, which for months has been having <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/17/color-says-not-shutting-down/">major turmoil at the executive levels</a>, was reported by VentureBeat to be finally <a target="_blank" href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/10/17/more-trouble-for-color-shareholders-and-board-vote-to-wind-down-company/">winding down its operations</a>, per an email reportedly sent by its VP of Finance. However, a spokesperson who works for its biggest investor Sequoia Capital <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/17/color-says-not-shutting-down/">told TechCrunch this morning</a> in no uncertain terms that those reports were untrue, and that Color was still in business. </p>
<p>And now this evening, a <a target="_blank" href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/10/18/color-gets-acquired-by-apple-rumor/">report by the TheNextWeb</a> co-headlined by Ken Yeung and Matthew Pazarino says that <a target="_blank" href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/10/18/color-gets-acquired-by-apple-rumor">Color has been acquired by Apple</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;We&#8217;ve heard through trusted sources that the startup was nabbed [by Apple] for a price that is in the ‘high double digits’, as in millions, and that the deal is &#8216;done&#8217;, though papers have yet to be signed.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>We at TechCrunch have not been able to verify this concretely, as this is a very complicated situation with many moving parts &#8212; which has been the case with Color stories for a while. The company&#8217;s board of directors and executives do not always present a united front when it comes to what&#8217;s happening there. We&#8217;re holding back on reporting this deal as fact until we know for sure.</p>
<p>But in conversations with people familiar with Color, we understand sale talks have indeed occurred around Color&#8217;s assets for some time. Namely, Color is still quite valuable for assets such as its engineers (not so much the non-technical members of its staff of around 30 people), its patents, and its trademarks. </p>
<p>According to the US PTO, Color has filed applications for a number <a target="_blank" href="http://www.faqs.org/patents/assignee/color-labs-inc/">of patents</a> on very general and very valuable things. We&#8217;re talking patents with titles such as &#8220;Sharing Content Among A Group Of Devices,&#8221; &#8220;Sharing Content Among Multiple Devices,&#8221; &#8220;Storage Of User Device Group Information,&#8221; and &#8220;User Device Group Information.&#8221; </p>
<p>The company also owns the trademark to its name. That&#8217;s right, it has the word &#8220;color&#8221; <a target="_blank" href="http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=85222392&amp;caseType=SERIAL_NO&amp;searchType=statusSearch">trademarked</a>. </p>
<p>Now, many people in the tech world think that these kinds of intellectual property claims are ridiculous and are <a target="_blank" href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/10/top-rackspace-lawyer-wed-love-to-get-rid-of-software-patents/">ultimately harming the ecosystem</a> much more than they&#8217;re helping. But patents and trademarks are still worth their weight in gold when it comes to the courtroom, so that sentiment hasn&#8217;t changed the way that big companies do business. Facebook spent <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/31/facebook-spent-24-million-on-acqui-hires-during-the-first-half-of-2012/">more than half a billion dollars</a> buying patents during the first half of 2012 alone. Google famously <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/25/google-sec-filing-details-why-it-paid-12-4-billion-for-motorola/">spent $12.4 billion to acquire Motorola Mobility</a>, $5.5 billion of which was for its patent portfolio alone. </p>
<p>From what we understand, Google has been long-rumored to have had a $200 million deal on the table for Color well before it even launched. </p>
<p>So, it&#8217;s not at all out of the question that Apple could very well be the one to ultimately snap up Color&#8217;s assets and engineers. Yes, Color may have a history of turmoil and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/23/color-looks-to-reinvent-social-interaction-with-its-mobile-photo-app-and-41-million-in-funding/">very lackluster performance</a> when it comes to attracting a user base, but it still holds those patents and a handful of talented engineers. And until the intellectual property system is truly reformed in a meaningful way, those patents more than anything else could be the key that lets a company like Color come out as a &#8220;successful exit&#8221; despite its other failures.</p>
