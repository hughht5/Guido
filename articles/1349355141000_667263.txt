But there is a bit of bad news, too. In fact it&#8217;s rather funny in a sad way: The app is not compatible with recent flagship devices including the Galaxy Nexus, Galaxy S III, HTC One X, and Galaxy Note.</p>
<p>The app looks lovely. The maps and navigation closely mirror the experience found on TomTom&#8217;s own hardware. And that&#8217;s a great. TomTom has long had one of the most user-friendly personal navigation devices on the market. </p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=TomTom+International+BV">app is available now</a> and costs around $50 for most regions. The US and Canadian version also requires 2.3GB of local storage space. So in case you&#8217;re disappointing with Google Map&#8217;s built-in turn by turn navigation, TomTom now has an expensive solution &#8212; that is, as long as you don&#8217;t have a popular phone.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/4/3453234/tomtom-android-offline-navigation-apps-price-download">Apparently</a> the app is limited by resolution, thus currently excluding high-resolution Android devices. The company is working on releasing a more compatible solution but for the near future, this app will not work with the aforementioned devices as well as the Nexus 7 tablet.</p>
