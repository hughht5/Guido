<p>&#8220;It&#8217;d be awesome to use technology to fix some of the problems that San Franciscans see every day,&#8221; says Twitter chairman and Square founder Jack Dorsey, in an all-star video promoting San Francisco&#8217;s new open government and tech advocacy group, sf.citi. Twitter co-founder Biz Stone imagines smart bus displays that track public and private transit in realtime, while Airbnb founder Brian Chesky wants to blanket the city with public Wi-Fi by converting old telephone booths (which <a target="_blank" href="http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/11/city-has-begun-converting-pay-phones-into-wi-fi-hot-spots/">has been done in New York</a>). Spearheaded by angel investor Ron Conway and backed by more than 300 prominent companies, sf.citi aims to hand over more government services to volunteer &#8220;civic&#8221; hackers and coordinate support for <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/ron-conway-and-sf-mayor-ed-lee-on-crucial-upcoming-tech-policy/">policy reforms</a>, such as the Proposition E tax reform.</p>

<p>The United States has been a leader in the open data movement, at least since <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System">Ronald Reagan released government global positioning system data</a> to the private sector, which helps power everything from smartphone maps to car GPS systems. More recently, President Obama&#8217;s senior technology advisor, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/23/the-21st-century-gold-rush-announced-at-disrupt-raw-data/">Todd Park</a>, vastly expanded the effort to include medical and education data, a small business-friendly government procurement process, and PayPal-like money transfer system for foreign aid. At the local level in San Francisco, former mayor and current California Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom ordered departments to release all non-confidential data to the public.</p>
<p>More recently, San Francisco saved itself thousands of dollars and many months of development time by giving a group of volunteer civic hackers beer, pizza, and access to the government&#8217;s data so they could develop an app for MUNI, the city&#8217;s municipal bus system. Additionally, migrating San Francisco&#8217;s police department <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/nevius/article/SF-police-get-new-crime-fighting-tools-computers-3674266.php">from paper to iPads</a> is estimated to save them many (crucial) man hours. Both the MUNI app and police project are under the continued support of Conway&#8217;s sf.citi.</p>
<p>sf.citi has initiatives on everything from education reform to open data, but passing local Proposition E &#8212; to start charging companies on their revenue rather than their payroll &#8212; is one of the major policy initiatives for Mayor Ed Lee and Conway. While ballot propositions have a notoriously difficult time in California, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ppic.org/content/pubs/report/R_904TGR.pdf">research</a> from the Public Policy Institute of California finds that local initiatives are far more successful than statewide measures (~80 percent vs. 40 percent). <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/matier-ross/article/Mungers-contribute-big-bucks-to-measures-3927168.php">Recent polling</a>, however, finds that only one-third of San Franciscans supported the measure (slightly more opposed).</p>
<p>The good news is that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/19/california-and-11-states-now-allow-online-voter-registration/">Californians can now register to vote online</a> and let their voices be heard.</p>
