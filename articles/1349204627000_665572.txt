The folks at <a href="http://techcrunch.com/tag/CanvasPop">CanvasPop</a> have proven that you can print your big honking photos onto big honking paper so you can have a hugenormously long photo on your wall.</p>
<p>The guys at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.canvaspop.com/">CanvasPop</a> told me to go take a panoramic picture and they set it to print at 10&#8243;x50&#8243; (the max is 15&#8243;x75&#8243;). The photo, arguably, is pretty terrible, but to prove it could be done, they slathered it down onto the material and now there exists an under-lit, vaguely menacing photograph of Sunset Park in Brooklyn.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the first ever panoramic print we&#8217;ve ever seen from an iPhone 5,&#8221; said Adrian Salamunovic. &#8220;I almost wanted to keep it for myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obviously this isn&#8217;t the first panoramic photo they&#8217;ve ever printed &#8211; the feature has been around for years &#8211; but this is the first one from an iPhone 5 and the quality is arguably quite good with the right lighting. I just need to find a mountain range or team of jolly, animal-themed kids to shoot instead of a rat-infested yard and necrotic New Jersey hulking down in its filth across the river. Some day a real rain will come and I&#8217;ll be there to take a panorama of it.</p>
