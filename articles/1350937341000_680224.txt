Mayer is <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/marissamayer/status/257958183476285440">back at work full-time</a> after taking a short maternity leave following the <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/zackbogue/status/252772825260236800">birth of her first child</a>, and is expected to speak about the financial results on her first conference call with Yahoo investors as CEO later this afternoon.</p>
<p>In all it was a solid quarter for Yahoo: The company made $1.2 billion in GAAP revenue, down slightly from the $1.22 billion it posted in <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/17/yahoo-reports-revenue-up-1-to-1-22b-earnings-at-27-cents-per-share/">the second quarter of 2012</a> and down one percent year-over-year from the third quarter of 2011. On a non-GAAP basis, Yahoo&#8217;s revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs was $1.089 billion, down two percent year-over-year from Q3 2011.</p>
<p>At the bottom line, Yahoo had earnings per share of $0.35 on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes a gain of $2.8 billion that Yahoo made through its sale of Alibaba shares as well as $16 million in restructuring charges. When those two things are factored in, Yahoo&#8217;s GAAP EPS is $2.64. Both these earnings results are up substantially from the EPS of $0.27 Yahoo posted in Q2 2012 and the $0.23 EPS the company posted in Q3 2011.</p>
<p>Wall Street analysts <a target="_blank" href="http://seekingalpha.com/currents/post/599001">projected</a> that Yahoo&#8217;s EPS would be $0.26, so the company&#8217;s actual results certainly exceeded those expectations. </p>
<p>&#8220;In the second quarter, non-GAAP earnings per share exceeded consensus and both display and search revenue ex-TAC showed modest growth,&#8221; Yahoo CFO Tim Morse said in a statement accompanying the financial report. </p>
<p>As encouraging as they are, the numbers are only part of the story, however &#8212; investors will surely be eager to hear more about Mayer&#8217;s overall vision for restoring Yahoo&#8217;s stance as an Internet industry powerhouse. In recent weeks Mayer has started to stock the upper ranks at Yahoo with a strong new slate of executives, the latest being her <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/16/yahoo-ceo-marissa-mayer-fills-coo-role-with-former-google-colleague-henrique-de-castro/">former Google colleague Henrique De Castro</a> in the COO role. Wall Street will certainly be keen to hear more detail about exactly what she and her executive team will be working on in the weeks and months ahead, so this earnings call should be one to watch.</p>
