<p>Get thee to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.4moms.com/breeze">4Mommery</a> because if you&#8217;re the parent of an infant/toddler, you have got to get you one of these. This is the smoothest, nicest playpen ever made by a home robotics company ever in the history of playpens, which is saying a lot.</p>
<p>As I <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/18/one-firm-push-hands-on-with-the-4moms-breeze-playpen/">mentioned here</a>, this is on TechCrunch because it&#8217;s one of the purest examples of an excellent product by a small hardware startup with a proven track record. </p>
<p>The Breeze is the smoothest, most-usable playpen I&#8217;ve seen. It opens and closes with one motion and, unlike similar models, there is no need to lock or unlock the sides with invisible buttons that rarely, if ever, engage. If you&#8217;re a parent or may take part in sexual reproduction at some point in your life, this is important to you simply because you&#8217;ll be either fighting with Pack &#8216;n&#8217; Plays until you die or you can just tote this bad mother around like a boss.</p>
<p>The Breeze is available now for $299.</p>
