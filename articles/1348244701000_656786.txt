<p>Heins revealed the service outage lasted up to three hours and that up to six per cent of the company&#8217;s user base were affected.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the statement in full</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I want to apologize to those BlackBerry customers in Europe and Africa who experienced an impact in their quality of service earlier this morning. The BlackBerry service is now fully restored and I can report that no data or messages were lost. Up to 6 per cent of our user base may have been impacted. Preliminary analysis suggests that those customers may have experienced a maximum delay of 3 hours in the delivery and reception of their messages. We are conducting a full technical analysis of this quality of service issue and will report as soon as it concludes. I again want to apologize to those customers who were impacted today.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The service outage did not affect voice calls or text messages but took down BBM, email and internet access. Heins&#8217; statement does not give any details on the cause of the outage &#8212; presumably because RIM is still investigating.</p>
