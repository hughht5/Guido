<p>Heins revealed the service outage lasted up to three hours and that up to six per cent of the company&#8217;s user base were affected.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the statement in full</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I want to apologize to those BlackBerry customers in Europe and Africa who experienced an impact in their quality of service earlier this morning. The BlackBerry service is now fully restored and I can report that no data or messages were lost. Up to 6 per cent of our user base may have been impacted. Preliminary analysis suggests that those customers may have experienced a maximum delay of 3 hours in the delivery and reception of their messages. We are conducting a full technical analysis of this quality of service issue and will report as soon as it concludes. I again want to apologize to those customers who were impacted today.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The service outage did not affect voice calls or text messages but took down BBM, email and internet access. Heins&#8217; statement does not give any details on the cause of the outage &#8212; presumably because RIM is still investigating.</p>
<p>Last October the BlackBerry network suffered a major outage that took the network for almost a week. The cause of that outage was traced to a switch failure in a UK datacenter causing a cascade of failures as a backlog of undelivered messages accrued &#8212; which in turn caused the system slow-down to spread further afield than the EMEA region.</p>
<p>At the time RIM pledged to audit its network, and then Co-CEO Mike Lazaridis apologized to customers in a YouTube video. RIM was also criticized for failing to promptly communicate last year&#8217;s outage to BlackBerry users. New CEO Heins appears to have learnt some of the 2011 outage&#8217;s lessons by putting out a quasi-detailed statement within hours of the outage &#8212; albeit without any explanation of the cause.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for RIM said the company has not yet passed on any information about the exact nature of these latest BlackBerry network gremlins.</p>
<p>The timing of the outage is doubly unfortunate &#8212; both because it&#8217;s approaching the one-year anniversary of last year&#8217;s BlackBerry outage and because today is the day Apple&#8217;s latest iPhone goes on sale.</p>
