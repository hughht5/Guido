<p>Today, however, the company has taken that number to 400 million since June. Siri tells me that&#8217;s an increase of 35 million, 9.5 percent growth.</p>
<p>Back at WWDC, the company stressed that 80 percent of those iOS device owners were using the latest version of Apple&#8217;s mobile operating system, iOS 5.1. But a shift is upon us, as iOS 6 is now available to owners of the iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, iPad 2 and the new iPad.</p>
<p>In its <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/24/apple-reports-disappointing-mac-sales-despite-retina-macbook-release-4-million-units-sold-in-q3-2012/">Q3 earnings report</a>, Apple announced selling 26 million iPhones, 17 million iPads, and 4 million Macs through the quarter. And with brand new devices on the table, you can only expect those numbers to go up come Q4 earnings time.</p>
