Today it became clear as Facebook ad chief David Fischer formally announced <a target="_blank" href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/ads-api/custom-audience-targeting/">&#8220;Custom Audience&#8221; ads</a> and how they tie into CRM at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/DF12/">Dreamforce conference</a>. I&#8217;m convinced they&#8217;re going to be hugely profitable for advertisers and Facebook.</p>
<p>Why? A car company with email addresses of its customers could target &#8220;buy a new SUV&#8221; ads to people who bought one 5+ years ago, while targeting &#8220;Find nearby charging stations&#8221; to those who recently bought an electric vehicle. That means more sales more loyalty for advertisers, and more revenue for Facebook.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/help/?page=273730399409300">Custom Audience</a> ads let businesses submit a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.insidefacebook.com/2012/08/30/facebook-may-soon-allow-ad-targeting-by-email-user-id-and-phone-number/">text or CSV file</a> of privacy-protected hashed email addresses, phone numbers, or Facebook User IDs and have Facebook target those people with a specific ad. Businesses can also layer on additional ad targeting parameters such as age or interests to reach a specific demographic within a customer segment.</p>
<p>Salesforce who brought in Fischer for its Dreamforce conference is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.buddymedia.com/newsroom/2012/09/salesforce-marketing-cloud-announces-facebook-custom-audience-targeting-integration/">uniquely suited to take advantage of custom audience ads</a> because it owns both its massively popular eponymous customer relationship management system, but also a Facebook ads buying system Brighter Option that it got with its acquisition of Buddy Media this summer.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve attained from Facebook the other the list of the seven other vendors working with custom audience ads, but none have their own CRM. They are AdParlor, Alchemy Social, GraphEffect, Kenshoo, Nanigans, Social Moov, and Optimal.</p>
<p>Custom audience targeted ads will be much more relevant than ads just targeted to a business&#8217; fans or some biographical demographic. They can reach people a business is sure have purchased its products before, or that haven&#8217;t thanks to exclusionary targeting.</p>
<p>Precise targeting of segments of existing customers could produce huge return on investment for advertisers and command high ad rates for Facebook. CRM-equipped companies might spend more when they knew who they&#8217;re reaching, and that could help Facebook please Wall Street with higher revenues.</p>
