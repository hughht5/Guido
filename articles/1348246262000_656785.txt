Google says it hopes this new <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/civic-information/">Google Civic Information API</a> will &#8220;unleash the creativity of the Internet and help you build innovative products that push civic information to your communities in interesting ways.&#8221; As the U.S. presidential election in November gets closer, the kind of information developers can access through the API tends to change frequently, but Google says it will make &#8220;every effort&#8221; to ensure that its data is accurate.</p>
<p>For now, this API only makes data about the U.S. election available to developers, but Google plans to expand it to other countries and to include other types of civic information. It&#8217;s also worth noting that Google is releasing the API today, but won&#8217;t have full live data available until the middle of October.</p>
<p>Google itself will use the new API to power its own election tools, including an embeddable app that anyone will be able to use on their sites.</p>
<p>Overall, the company has consistently been adding more election tools to its lineup over the last few years. Most of these, though, were either aimed directly at <a target="_blank" href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/01/keeping-up-with-2012-us-election-with.html">consumers</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/educators/elections_tools.html">teachers</a> or politicians. Google also recently offered dedicated sites for a number of international elections, including those in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com.eg/elections/ed/eg">Egypt</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.fr/elections/ed/fr">France</a>. In previous years, Google also offered a dedicated <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/gec/">Election Center API</a>, but that API has now been deprecated and Google is asking developers to use the new Civic Information API instead.</p>
