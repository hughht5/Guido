<p>Oh, and in case you care, the phone will also appear on-screen as James Bond&#8217;s phone of choice in <em>Skyfall.</em> Then again, what else is new &#8212; Daniel Craig&#8217;s version of the iconic secret agent has been using Sony phones for his two previous forays on-screen.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a quick recap of the T/TL in case you really don&#8217;t feel like clicking that link &#8212; Sony&#8217;s new flagship sports a 4.6-inch Reality display running at 720p, a 1.5GHz dual-core Qualcomm MSM8260-A processor (the same as the one seen in HTC&#8217;s slim One S), and a fast-booting 13-megapixel camera. </p>
<p>In terms of connectivity, the TL will play nice with AT&amp;T&#8217;s LTE network, and there&#8217;s an NFC chipset tucked in there as well to help facilitate one-touch file sharing (and potentially Isis-powered <a target="_blank" href="http://news.paywithisis.com/tag/phone-news/">mobile payments?</a>). The whole shebang runs on Android 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich for the time being, and while Sony confirmed that a Jelly Bean update would be pushed &#8220;following launch,&#8221; there&#8217;s no telling how long it&#8217;ll take an update like that to pass through AT&amp;T&#8217;s testing and certification process. </p>
<p>Honestly though, AT&amp;T&#8217;s announcement isn&#8217;t exactly news if you&#8217;ve been paying close attention these past few weeks. In the days leading up to Sony&#8217;s Xperia unveiling at IFA, it was revealed that Sony Mobile had filed <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gsmarena.com/sony_trademarks_xperia_tl_name_in_the_us-news-4701.php">a trademark application</a> for &#8220;Xperia TL&#8221; with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Even more tell was the fact that the Xperia T was spotted on a U.K. retailer&#8217;s website rocking <a target="_blank" href="http://www.androidcentral.com/sony-xperia-t-appears-promo-shot-att-branding">AT&amp;T&#8217;s familiar logo</a> (see below) just a few days after Sony&#8217;s official announcement. The real meat here &#8212; when the TL will launch and how much it&#8217;ll cost when it does &#8212; is notably absent in AT&amp;T&#8217;s release.</p>
