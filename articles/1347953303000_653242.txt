<p>The new head honcho tweeted this Instagram image earlier today, of a disenfranchised ® peg, formerly of a campus Yahoo! logo. Mayer provided an explanation, &#8220;One of our new Yahoo!s Andrew was really bugged by the registered trademark symbol at the end of our logo; he&#8217;s gone on a mission removing all the R&#8217;s from our site and our campus. This is one on the random R&#8217;s we pulled off a wall  &#8220;</p>
<p>Why the newfound design snobbery? Well perhaps because you&#8217;d be hard-pressed to find a successful Internet startup with a Registered Trademark tacked on to its logo. &#8220;Legal assures us that our trademark is implied and quite secure  ,&#8221; Mayer confirmed on Twitter. Well, since you&#8217;re getting rid of dead weight all of a sudden &#8230;</p>
<p>Exclamation point, your days are numbered.</p>
