It is starting to seem like there&#8217;s a startup providing subscription delivery services for just about everything: <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/06/dollar-shave-club/">Razors</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/20/love-with-food-launches-as-a-monthly-subscription-service-for-gourmet-bites/">snacks</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/01/greylock-backed-citrus-lane-helps-parents-discover-best-of-products-for-little-ones/">kids items</a>, makeup, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/09/meundies-wants-to-send-you-a-new-pair-of-underwear-every-month/">underwear</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/27/brit-co-gets-into-e-commerce-brit-kits-subscription/">DIY craft tools</a>, even <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/23/subscription-condoms-dumb-dumb-dumb/">condoms</a> and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/27/boink-box/">sex toys</a>. Some of these things are necessities, but many of them are not exactly must-haves &#8212; but still, people are loving the monthly subscription e-commerce model.</p>
<p>The newest entrant in this space is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.getjuniper.com">Juniper</a>, a startup that is providing monthly deliveries of items that a huge segment of the population absolutely needs on a monthly basis: Tampons and sanitary napkins.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a topic that always makes people blush a bit, so Juniper&#8217;s business model sounds funny at first, but when you start to think about it, it makes a lot of sense. The vast majority of adult women out there need these items once a month, but shopping for them is always a chore and potentially embarrassing &#8212; you never want to run into, say, a professional acquaintance while you&#8217;re buying a box of maximum absorbency Tampax and a giant bag of Peanut M&amp;Ms at Walgreen&#8217;s.</p>
<p>So Juniper handles it all for you. For $28, every 28 days (or longer or shorter, depending on personal preference) Juniper sends the tampons of your choice in a discreet box along with a handful of pads and pantiliners and a curated selection of goodies such as chocolate, tea, and sweets. As with all subscription e-commerce startups, the tech angle here is Juniper&#8217;s data and inventory management and the level of personalization it provides to each user.</p>
<p>Juniper, which is based in San Francisco and currently bootstrapped with a staff of three, just launched last week. Co-founder and CEO Lynn Tao stopped by TechCrunch TV to talk to us a bit about the company and show us a Juniper Box in person. Watch the video above to hear about where the concept for Juniper came from and how the company plans to grow in the months ahead.</p>
