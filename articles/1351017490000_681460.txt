After introducing the iPad Mini, Apple&#8217;s SVP of Worldwide Marketing, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/pr/bios/philip-w-schiller.html">Phil Schiller</a>, did a side-by-side comparison of the new iPad versus the leading Android tablet, Google&#8217;s Nexus 7. &#8220;Others have tried to make tablets smaller than the iPad, and they&#8217;ve failed miserably,&#8221; Schiller said. &#8220;These are not great experiences.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was kind of remarkable to see Apple taking what some would call the &#8220;low road,&#8221; and actually comparing their product to that of the competition in such unkind terms. It&#8217;s the first time that Apple has really taken the trash-talking to this level &#8211; at least in recent years.</p>

<p>On the screen behind Schiller, the iPad Mini was shown next to a Nexus 7, although Schiller never referred to it by name. He stated that when you’re web surfing, you can see 49% more content because there are no on-screen controls with the iPad Mini. The screenshot showed the Guggenheim website in portrait mode. In landscape mode, the iPad offered 67% more content, Schiller said. But in the comparison, the Android tablet is not shown running a browser in full screen mode.</p>
<p>Schiller also said the iPad&#8217;s bezel is aluminum and &#8220;theirs&#8221; is plastic and thicker. &#8220;In fact, the entire Android product is thicker and heavier than iPad Mini even though it has a smaller display,&#8221; Schiller commented.  He points out that in terms of overall display the iPad Mini is 29.6&#8243; versus the 21.9&#8243; for the Nexus 7.</p>
<p>Schiller then does side-by-side comparisons of the iPad Mini and the &#8220;other&#8221; tablet, showing apps like Yelp, Pandora, Vimeo, eBay and TripAdvisor in action. Of course, the iPad Mini comes out looking better in these comparisons. It&#8217;s burn after burn after burn. &#8221;You get a tablet experience on the iPad Mini,&#8221; Schiller said. &#8220;You get a scaled-up phone experience on the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ouch.</p>
<p>Notably, Schiller does not do side-by-side shots of Apple versus Google Maps. Go figure.</p>
