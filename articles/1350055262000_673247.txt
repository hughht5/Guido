It&#8217;s actually very common for modern-day optics systems, but long-time users aren&#8217;t really used to it.</p>
<p>So the folks at <a target="_blank" href="http://fotodioxpro.com/index.php/">FotoDiox</a> have brought a fix to the table: the <a target="_blank" href="http://fotodioxpro.com/index.php/camhoodie-lens-hood-case-for-iphone-5-greatly-reduces-purple-lens-flare.html">CamHoodie case for iPhone 5</a>.</p>
<p>The case greatly reduces the amount of purple lens flare both in stills and capturing video. It&#8217;s relatively simple in design, made of high-grade rubber and plastic.</p>
<p>Essentially, it&#8217;s a lens hood for the iPhone 5 camera lens, and it &#8220;provide[s] a little cocoon of protection from stray light rays entering the lens elements from the edges of the frame,&#8221; according to the product page.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s not to say it resolves the purple haze entirely, but it clearly makes a difference (just check out the videos below).</p>

<p>Just in case you aren&#8217;t caught up, Apple support <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/01/apple-support-purple-flaring-is-normal-behavior-for-iphone-5-camera/">responded</a> to many purple flare complaints that this was normal and to angle the camera differently. Apple even gave an <a target="_blank" href="http://support.apple.com/kb/TS4436">official response</a>.</p>
<p>Hooray for the ecosystem!</p>
