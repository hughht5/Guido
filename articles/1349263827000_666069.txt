This is the hotel booking company&#8217;s first acquisition.</p>
<p>The financial terms of the deal are not being disclosed, but the companies say PrimaTable CEO Jamie Davidson (<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/28/in-the-studio-primatables-jamie-davidson-has-a-taste-for-culinary-experiences/">a former YouTube and Google engineer</a>) will be become HotelTonight&#8217;s vice president of product, while his co-founder Colin Zima has been named data scientist. PrimaTable&#8217;s third team member, a developer, is also joining HotelTonight. The PrimaTable service itself, which offered users last-minute reservations and custom experiences at high-class restaurants, will be shut down.</p>
<p>As the name implies, HotelTonight allows you to find a hotel, well, tonight. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/18/hoteltonight-personalization-4-0/">It launched a redesigned app a couple of weeks ago</a>. Co-founder and CEO Sam Shank tells me that when he started talking to PrimaTable, it was like &#8220;a mind meld&#8221; â€” in part, because the companies were working on very similar problems (filling &#8220;perishable, last-minute inventory&#8221;) in different industries. So when the PrimaTable team reached a &#8220;decision point&#8221; about whether it could build a big consumer brand, Shank made the acquisition offer.</p>
<p>&#8220;These guys will be taking their knowledge about yield optimization and mobile commerce, and bringing all those skills to us,&#8221; Shank says. He adds that no, this doesn&#8217;t mean HotelTonight is getting into the restaurant reservation business: &#8220;We will remain focused on hotels.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a lot of ways, this sounds a classic &#8220;acqui-hire&#8221;, but the deal isn&#8217;t just about hiring the PrimaTable team. Because a lot of the backend issues are the same, aspects of PrimaTable&#8217;s technology will be &#8220;ported over into the HotelTonight platform,&#8221; Shank says.</p>
<p>HotelTonight has raised $35.7 million from Battery Ventures, Accel Partners, First Round Capital, US Venture Partners, and others.</p>
