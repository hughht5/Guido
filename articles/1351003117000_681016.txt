The coupons are being made available from digital couponing giant, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.coupons.com">Coupons.com</a>, which is now offering Passbook coupons directly on its website.</p>
<p>In total, there are 20 participating merchants with 34 offers available at launch, some of which are exclusive to Coupons.com. The company, whose website now sees 21 million monthly uniques, says that it will begin to offer even more exclusive deals to Passbook coupon users in the future.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/23/twenty-major-retailers-launch-passbook-enabled-coupons-via-digital-offers-giant-coupons-com/passbook-couponscom/" rel="attachment wp-att-681045"></a>Currently, you can find the coupons on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.coupons.com">the Coupons.com homepage</a>, which is mobile-optimized for the iPhone&#8217;s web browser. From there, it&#8217;s simply a matter of tapping the &#8220;Get Coupons&#8221; button underneath the &#8220;Passbook&#8221; section at the top. You&#8217;ll then be redirected to a second page where you can browse through the available offers. When you see one you like, tap the &#8220;Add to Passbook&#8221; button, then tap the &#8220;Add&#8221; button to save the coupon to your digital wallet. At checkout, you&#8217;ll show the coupon on your iPhone&#8217;s screen to the cashier who can then scan the barcode. In case of scanning troubles, a numeric code is also provided, which can be entered directly into the register.</p>
<p>The company also offers a Coupons.com iOS application, but the integration of Passbook coupons into that app is not yet complete. The Coupons.com app today is focused mainly on grocery coupons and consumer packaged goods. The company tells us that it does have plans to Passbook-enable those coupons as well, and not just with its consumer packaged goods partners, but also in other categories like home improvement, entertainment, restaurants, and more.Â Unfortunately, there&#8217;s no ETA on when these integrations will complete.</p>
<p>The complete list of supported retailers and brands for today&#8217;s launch includes: Avenue, Barnes &amp; Noble, Bon-Ton, Carter&#8217;s, Champion, Gordmans, Harbor Freight Tools, Jo-Ann, Lane Bryant, Macy&#8217;s, Michaels, Old Navy, OshKosh B&#8217;gosh, PETCO, PetSmart, Shopko, Spirit Halloween, Sweet Tomatoes, ULTA Beauty and Yankee Candle.</p>
<p>The majority of the coupons are offering a discount on your next purchase, so they&#8217;re definitely worth checking out. And you can add as many as you want to Passbook without cluttering up your wallet because of how they&#8217;re grouped in the Passbook interface. Instead of making each coupon its own &#8220;card&#8221; of sorts, Coupons.com&#8217;s deals only take up one visible position in the app, but when you tap on its blue &#8220;card,&#8221; you&#8217;re able to then flip through your Coupons.com offers from left to right. You can get started adding the new coupons from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.coupons.com">here</a>, using your iOS device&#8217;s browser.</p>
