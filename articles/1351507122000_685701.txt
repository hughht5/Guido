The 16GB model will soon cost $199, down from the original $249 MSRP. Likewise, a new model, a 32GB flavor, will occupy the $249 price point. There&#8217;s no word what&#8217;s to come of the 8GB model although early speculation stated that it could drop in price by as much as $100. </p>
<p>Google <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/27/raincheck-google-cancels-nyc-android-event-planned-for-monday-due-to-hurricane-sandy/">was supposed to have</a> a big Android event today in NYC. But Hurricane Sandy decided to visit The Big Apple, take in a show and blow-in the sights. </p>
<p>The new Nexus 7 prices comes by Office Depot, a major US electronic retailer, which is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.droid-life.com/2012/10/28/32gb-nexus-7-goes-on-display-at-office-depot-for-249-16gb-drops-to-199/">currently displaying</a> the 32GB model in one of its stores. The pricing is in line with recent speculation. </p>
<p>Google was expected to reveal the new Nexus 7 models at today&#8217;s now-canceled Android event. The <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/26/here-comes-the-nexus-4-smartphone-nexus-7-3g-tablet-and-the-nexus-10-ipad-killer/">widely-leaked Nexus 4 LG smartphone</a> and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/26/this-is-the-nexus-10/">Nexus 10 Samsung tablet</a> was also supposed to be announced. Google has yet to reschedule the event and timing is everything. At this point it might not be possible to announces these products at a big dog and pony show before they hit retailers; the holiday season is upon us and retailers are not going to reschedule their plans because Google didn&#8217;t get to host a media circus.</p>
