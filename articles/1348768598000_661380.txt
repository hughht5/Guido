There&#8217;s no mystery to its existence. The franchise has been a runaway hit for years, and continues to be the top revenue-generating game for the company &#8212; despite being more weather-beaten cockerel than spring chicken these days (user numbers have certainly declined since its <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2009/09/30/zynga-is-on-a-tear-claims-nearly-130-million-social-gamers/">2009</a>/<a target="_blank" href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/31675/Phrases_Overtakes_FarmVille_As_Top_Facebook_App.php?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+GamasutraNews+%28Gamasutra+News%29#.UGSGJ6SnuzA">2010 heyday</a>).</p>
<p>Still, <a target="_blank" href="http://investor.zynga.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1193125-12-319961&amp;CIK=1439404">FarmVille accounted for almost a third (29%) of Zynga&#8217;s online gaming revenue</a> in the six months ending June 30, beating its newer urban-themed game CityVille (which accounted for 15%). A sequel to extend the life of the FarmVille cash-cow was inevitable. And lo and behold, earlier this month <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/05/zynga-finally-debuts-farmville-2-promises-to-keep-working-on-the-original-too/">FarmVille 2 finally opened its stable doors for business</a> &#8212; with another bucolic dose of country life. Here be gently rolling hills, neatly tilled patches of ludicrously fecund earth, chickens, goats, cows, horses, you name it.</p>
<p>But actually there&#8217;s something missing from this picture. Where are all the pigs?</p>
<p>Apart from one single, doe-eyed specimen, lurking in the corner of a <a target="_blank" href="https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/c0.0.403.403/p403x403/394756_432779786753877_1214312377_n.jpg">&#8216;Coming Soon&#8217; graphic</a> posted to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/FarmVille2">FarmVille 2 Facebook page</a> back in June, we haven&#8217;t been able to find any swine at all.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not exhaustive players of FarmVille 2 &#8212; so we&#8217;re prepared to admit we might be wrong. We&#8217;ve reached out to Zynga to ask about the FarmVille 2 Aporkalypse, as we&#8217;re terming it (either that or &#8216;Piggygate&#8217;), and will update when we hear back. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/27/farmville-2-aporkalypse-where-are-the-pigs-in-zyngas-new-social-gaming-cash-cow/screen-shot-2012-09-27-at-13-58-29/" rel="attachment wp-att-661634"></a></p>
<p>This is not the first time we&#8217;ve noticed something missing from one of Zynga&#8217;s realities. Last year <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/02/26/the-separation-of-church-and-zynga-wedding-chapels-stripped-from-cityville/">disappearing wedding chapels</a> in CityVille caught our eye. In that instance the chapels had actually appeared in the game before undergoing a not-so-subtle transformation into anodyne &#8216;wedding halls&#8217; (&#8220;with two gold ring things that somehow makes me think only of McDonalds&#8221;, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/02/26/the-separation-of-church-and-zynga-wedding-chapels-stripped-from-cityville/">as TC founder Michael Arrington put it</a>.)</p>
<p>Continuing the religious correctness theme, we&#8217;re speculating FarmVille 2&#8242;s missing pigs could be explained by it being <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.games.com/2012/09/11/farmville-2-arabic/">Zynga&#8217;s first game localised for the Middle East and North Africa</a> &#8211; a region where pork isn&#8217;t, you know, popular.</p>
<p>An alternative wildcard theory could be that Rovio&#8217;s Angry Birds &#8212; and now also <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/27/rovios-bad-piggies-goes-live-in-the-app-store-build-bridges-dont-burn-them/">Bad Piggies</a> &#8211; have all but trademarked porcine gaming characters. You could say Rovio&#8217;s smug, thieving pigs are hogging all the limelight right now&#8230;</p>
