<p>Likewise, it gives &#8220;media, advertisers, designers and creatives&#8221; a new avenue to license fresh material &#8212; that&#8217;s because, in what is being described as &#8216;sync&#8217; licensing, SoundCloud users can embed the license button immediately after they&#8217;ve hit publish, removing much of the friction traditionally associated with licensing music for visual projects.</p>
<p>Any of SoundCloud&#8217;s 20m registered users &#8212; made of up songwriters and other sound creators &#8212; can make their original content available for licensing simply by adding the &#8220;license&#8221; button from Getty Images Music to their SoundCloud player.</p>
<p>Commercial users can then request a license for any of those tracks by clicking the &#8220;license&#8221; button, after which Getty Images Music&#8217;s licensing department takes over. If the track has never been licensed before, the process is said to take between a few days or a few weeks, dependant on paperwork and the necessary clearance.</p>
