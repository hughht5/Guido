<p>SigFig declined to comment for this post. I also reached out to Yahoo and will update if I hear back.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t heard too many details about how the partnership will work, but I&#8217;m guessing it won&#8217;t be too different from the startup&#8217;s <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/17/sigfig-usa-today-redesign-portfolio-tracker-partnership/">recently launched integration with USA Today</a>, where you can find a portfolio tracker that&#8217;s &#8220;powered by SigFig&#8221; embedded in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/personal-finance/">the newspaper website&#8217;s personal finance section</a>, which includes the full SigFig functionality.</p>
<p>So when the integration goes live, Yahoo&#8217;s portfolio tracking page will probably start looking a lot more like SigFig. This is a big win for a product that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/01/sigfig-beta-launch/">only launched in May</a> of this year (the company itself is older). In fact, it&#8217;s probably an even bigger deal than the USA Today partnership, because <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/13/business/media/cnbc-and-yahoo-finance-expand-partnership-to-online-video.html?_r=0">according to comScore</a>, Yahoo Finance remains the most popular site for business-finance news and research.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a nice shift from the team&#8217;s old guise as Wikinvest, a financial news and data site that was being pitched as <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2009/06/24/wikinvest-aims-for-yahoo-finance-in-redesign/">a direct competitor to Yahoo Finance</a>. With SigFig, it seems that the startup isn&#8217;t trying to challenge stablished sites like Yahoo, but instead partnering with them to build its audience.</p>
