The streaming music service would be a <a title="Apple’s Stream Dreams: The History Of A Potential Pandora Killer" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/15/apples-stream-dreams-the-history-of-a-potential-pandora-killer/">natural next step in the progression Apple&#8217;s taken with digital music</a>, but it looks like licensing issues may have stepped in the way<a target="_blank" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-06/apple-tv-no-iphone-as-talks-bog-down-with-media-companies.html"> once again</a>.</p>
<p>According to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nypost.com/f/mobile/news/business/sony_bites_apple_kKe2i0rFHlCbeFRq5cJeiO">New York Post,</a> citing &#8220;sources close to the situation,&#8221; music publishers Sony/ATV wouldn&#8217;t agree to Apple&#8217;s proposed terms, seeking more in terms of a per-song rights fee from the tech industry leader to provide access to its content library for a streaming service.</p>
<p>Sony/ATV is part of Ascap and BMI, copyright associations that normally handle licensing rights for publishers, but the Post&#8217;s sources claim Apple had to go direct to Sony/ATV because of the nature of its service, described as a &#8220;souped-up streaming service.&#8221; That service would reportedly be like Pandora, offering personalized radio streams, but with an added &#8220;element of promotion based on what music labels are pushing in any one month,&#8221; says the Post&#8217;s sources.</p>
<p>Alongside the bump in the road for Apple come alongside news that Sony/ATV is about to leave Ascap and BMI, which could mean that existing services like Pandora and others lose access to their libraries as well, which covers 2 million copyrights including some top artists.</p>
<p>The planned Apple music service was reportedly intended to accompany the iPhone 5&#8242;s launch. There could be some truth to that, as Apple notably didn&#8217;t include any iPhone 5-specific software features (which didn&#8217;t also <a title="iOS 6 Is Now Available: Here’s What Features Your iDevice Gets" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/19/ios-6-is-now-available-heres-what-features-your-idevice-gets/">get provided to the iPhone 4S via iOS 6</a>) in its release, something we&#8217;ve seen happen in the past with the iPhone 4S, 4 and earlier devices.</p>
<p>The report claims we&#8217;ll still likely see a streaming Pandora competitor eventually released from Apple as an update down the road, but there&#8217;s no timeline mentioned and it&#8217;ll likely depend on how licensing negotiation goes from here on out.</p>
