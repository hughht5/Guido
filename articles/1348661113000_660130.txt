<p>The company was founded by Seamus McAteer (CEO), previously co-founder of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2008/05/28/comscore-buys-mmetrics-for-44-million-to-measure-the-mobile-web/">comScore-acquired mobile data startup M:Metrics</a>, and Mike Rowehl (CTO), the first engineer at <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2009/11/09/google-acquires-admob/">Google-acquired AdMob</a>. It spun out of Churn Labs, the startup generator that was created by Rowehl and AdMob founder Omar Hamoui. (In fact, Rowehl and Hamoui&#8217;s decisions to focus full-time on specific startups <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/31/churn-lab-shut-down/">led to Churn&#8217;s shutdown</a>.)</p>
<p>McAteer tells me Metaresolver isn&#8217;t trying to create divide the audience into segments like <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/24/admobius-launch-series-a/">the just-launched AdMobius</a>, but instead working on the step before that. The startup works with digital agencies to provide &#8220;clean, trustworthy data&#8221; that can serve as &#8220;the foundation&#8221; for smarter media buying. </p>
<p>Every ad impression already comes with some significant data, McAteer says, including the viewer&#8217;s latitude-longitude and device, but it&#8217;s often inaccurate.</p>
<p>&#8220;At least somewhere between 10 and 15 percent of the time, that data is categorically incorrect,&#8221; he says. &#8220;There are a lot of lat-longs resolving to a corn field in Kansas. A lot of vetting needs to be done with the data.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Metaresolver tries to provide that vetting, taking the basic data and cleaning it up. If you look beyond mobile advertising, McAteer says there&#8217;s &#8220;nothing new&#8221; about what Metaresolver is doing: &#8220;It&#8217;s tried and testing marketing media intelligence. We&#8217;re starting with really a clean, foundational data set, and we&#8217;re coupling that with programmatic media buying.&#8221;</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Metaresolver raised a seed round led by Baseline Ventures and Harrison Metal Capital, with participation from Lerer Ventures, Eniac Ventures and iHatch Management. (Metaresolver&#8217;s CrunchBase profile says it was a $1.85 million, but I&#8217;m still trying to confirm that number with the company.) The company says it has been working with beta customers since May.</p>
