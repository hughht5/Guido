We have something special to give away. Box is hosting its annual <a target="_blank" href="https://www.box.com/boxworks/">BoxWorks event </a>October 7-9 in San Francisco. And we have a bunch of tickets. </p>
<p>Box has some amazing speakers on tap. Box CEO Aaron Levie kicks things off and followed by Marc Andresssen, John Donahoe, and Clayton Christensen. There&#8217;s also Tony Fadell, Gary Reiner and Gary Kovacs along with Adam Lashinsky, Andreas Bechtolsheim and our own Drew Olanoff. It&#8217;s three days, six keynotes, 55 speakers, and a ton of fun.</p>
<p>So, here we go. There will be 10 winners and each winner can bring a friend, so we have 20 tickets in total. If you want a shot at winning one of these tickets, all you have to do is follow the steps below.</p>
