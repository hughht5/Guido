<p>Without sounding too much like a reality TV show, I can&#8217;t sleep. Observing the wasteland in front of the Apple Store Fifth Avenue helps a bit. Yet, the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/20/in-line-for-the-iphone-5-as-the-craze-of-the-day-settles-down-neighbors-share-line-experiences/">Apple line heroes</a> have no problem sleeping at all. It&#8217;s probably because they have been sleeping outside for the past few days.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;m typing these words, it is 4am, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ted.com/talks/rives_on_4_a_m.html">the new midnight</a>. People in front of the line are sleeping, those at the back didn&#8217;t bring a chair and are still standing, wide awake. Television vehicles make an incredibly annoying noise behind me and the hotdog smell from a food cart not so far away is not something you are looking for when you want to sleep.</p>
<p>&#8220;All of this for a phone?&#8221; keep asking the people on the sidewalk. After seeing someone walking and shouting &#8220;iPhone 5! iPhone 5!&#8221; with an iPhone 5 in his hand, I can definitely say that it is a tad too much for just a phone. Instead of showing his iPhone 5 around at 4am, he could have slept peacefully in his bed, or at least lent it to me â€” the bed of course.</p>
<p>And of course, it&#8217;s cold out there. For all those reasons, I can&#8217;t think straight right now. But be sure to watch the live stream of the iPhone 5 launch at 7am tomorrow. After that night, I don&#8217;t want you to miss it.</p>
