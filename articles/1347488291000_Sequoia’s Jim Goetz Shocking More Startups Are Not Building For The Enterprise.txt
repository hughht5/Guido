<p>It&#8217;s the notion of reinventing the IT stack that holds such opportunity, Goetz said. And it&#8217;s an opportunity for everyone in the Disrupt audience. Companies like Salesforce.com have helped pave the way with SaaS models that build revenues based on subscriptions.</p>
<p>&#8220;The business model is now a weapon for all of you,&#8221; Goetz said. &#8220;It allows you to disrupt legacy vendors. It makes it very difficulty for them to compete.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is also a major tech shift happening in the market, Goetz said. You have Flash becoming important for the server. Virtualization is now standard in the enterprise. You have new architectures.</p>
<p>Startups in the enterprise space face a different dynamic. They have only one or two competitors, and they are usually legacy providers.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is almost blue ocean,&#8221; Goetz said.</p>
<p>Palo Alto Networks Founder Nir Zuk came on stage to join Goetz. He said it takes two years to build an enterprise product. It takes two months to build a consumer service.</p>
<p>&#8220;How can you be proud of that?&#8221; Zuk asked.</p>
