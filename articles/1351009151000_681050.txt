<p>You&#8217;re a dude. You want to look good. No, you don&#8217;t want to spend hours in a store.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lookcraft.com/">Lookcraft</a>, a brand new New York-based startup, comes in. Founded by some YC alums, Lookcraft has customers go through a quick (and hopefully painless) style quiz where they click on clothes they like, share their sizing and a little bit about how they like to dress. It then comes up with seven or so items that are shipped for free.</p>
<p>Like Chicago-based Trunk Club, you send back what you don&#8217;t like and you pay for what you keep. There are no subscriptions. Lookcraft sends kits of clothing whenever a customer requests it, and they collect your credit card information up front. If you don&#8217;t like the suggestions Lookcraft provides, you can easily swap items in or out until you have a combination that you do like.</p>
<p>&#8220;The men&#8217;s shopping experience is terrible. Basically, it&#8217;s built entirely for women,&#8221; said co-founder <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/jamiequint">Jamie Quint</a>. &#8220;For men who don&#8217;t want to go through Macy&#8217;s website for hours, we try to make it easy. We give them suggestions and then ship them for free.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup carries a number of higher-end brands like Nudie Jeans, J Shoes and local independent brands like San Francisco&#8217;s Taylor Stitch.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re focused on fit and quality and we&#8217;re not going to sacrifice by buying lower-quality stuff to get a lower price point,&#8221; Quint said. &#8220;There&#8217;s a reason why designer clothing costs more. It&#8217;s because there&#8217;s better quality, better fit and fabrics than what you&#8217;d find elsewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company makes standard retail margins on its bundles of clothing, which on average are worth about $800 or $900. They sell clothes at full retail price. &#8221;It&#8217;s basically the same as how any wholesale merchant makes money,&#8221; Quint said.</p>
<p>Lookcraft has raised some seed funding from First Round Capital and Consigliere Brands, a marketing consultancy and New York-based fund run by two-time NBA MVP Steve Nash.</p>
<p>&#8220;The major retailers aren&#8217;t going to be the ones to innovate on the online shopping experience. They list clothes and sell them. The average of their customers are trending upwards,&#8221; Quint said. &#8220;It&#8217;s time for someone to do something new.&#8221;</p>
