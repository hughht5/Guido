No sales figures have come out of either camp, but it makes sense for B&amp;N to head Amazon off at the pass, especially since the Paperwhite is shipping on October 1 and could put a dent in Nook sales.</p>
<p>The new <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/06/amazon-officially-announces-the-new-kindle-paperwhite-paperwhite-display-frontlighting-and-212-ppi/">Paperwhite</a> has a glowing, frontlit screen that turns the traditional grey drab of an e-ink device into a bright white page. The Nook with GlowLight looks nearly as good and is also a solid device. At this point it basically comes down to which company you&#8217;ve already trusted with your e-library.</p>
<p>The e-reader wars are now about platform popularity. It&#8217;s the company that can grab the most readers in the shortest amount of time that wins and this price drop is evidence of the high stakes both companies are facing.</p>
