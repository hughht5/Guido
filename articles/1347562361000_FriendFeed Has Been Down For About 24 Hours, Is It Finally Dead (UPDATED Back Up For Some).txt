Content continued to flow, and in fact, it looks like FriendFeed still possesses the infamous &#8220;Twitter firehose.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alarmingly, again&#8230;for some, FriendFeed hasn&#8217;t been available for the past 24 hours. I&#8217;m told by sources that this is one of, if not the, longest outages since the site&#8217;s inception. Sure, the team went on to work at Facebook, but the site has remained up and reliable since then.</p>
<p>Bret Taylor, one of FriendFeed&#8217;s founders, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/15/bret-taylor/">recently left Facebook from his CTO gig</a>, and it&#8217;s not known at this time what he&#8217;s working on. Taylor once said that <a target="_blank" href="http://venturebeat.com/2010/04/21/friendfeed-shutdown/">Facebook had no plans on shutting down the site</a>. So, what&#8217;s up?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what you see when you try to log in:</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Facebook and Taylor to see if anything has changed with the plans to keep FriendFeed alive. Clearly, it&#8217;s not a priority, and that makes total sense. It would be nice to know, though! Many of FriendFeed&#8217;s users have gone over to Google+, as the streams are somewhat similar, minus the ability to cross-post every single thing you have ever done on the Internet. Ugh.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> After this long downtime episode, some folks are reporting that they&#8217;re able to access their precious FriendFeed again. The unofficial downtime was 19 hours. This now leads me to the question&#8230;why does it still exist? To keep the fanboys and girls happy, or is it a test-bed for innovation at Facebook?</p>
