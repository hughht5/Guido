The  new iPod were first given the open-ended retail window of &#8220;October&#8221; when initially announced, and then<a title="Pre-Order Customers Report 5th Generation iPod Touch Now Preparing To Ship" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/05/pre-order-customers-report-5th-generation-ipod-touch-now-preparing-to-ship/"> began rolling out to pre-order customers</a> earlier this month.</p>
<p>The new iPod touch boasts the 4-inch display of the iPhone 5, as well as Bluetooth 4.0 and the new Lightning connector I/O standard. The touch does get the shaft a bit when it comes to processor (A5 vs. A6 on iPhone) and RAM (512MB vs. 1GB on the smartphone), but reviews generally suggest that in practice, the difference isn&#8217;t all that noticeable. Apple also offers the latest iPod touch in six different colors, a first for this particular line of its personal media players.</p>
<p>The new iPod nano is another dramatic design departure for Apple&#8217;s most affordable media player with a screen, with a 2.5-inch multi-touch display, Bluetooth and a Lightning port. This generation replaces the small square nano with the integrated clip, which spawned countless variants on the wristwatch strap case accessory.</p>
<p>When the new iPod first started showing specific anticipated ship times, they were at 3 weeks back in the first week of October, so going to 5-7 days now is probably just the clock ticking down on that original estimate, which means Apple is still selling units from what&#8217;s likely its second large production batch after handling pre-order shipments. Generally, Apple&#8217;s iPods have enjoyed declining fortunes compared to its other product lines. This year, watching how the new iPods fare in a lineup that includes not only the iPhone and iPad, but also a host of iPad mini models should prove very interesting.</p>
