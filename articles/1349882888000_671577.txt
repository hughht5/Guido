To that end, TechCrunch has learned that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.deezer.com">Deezer</a>, the music streaming service which <a title="Deezer Pulls Back Curtain On Growth Strategy: Adds 76 More Countries, Free Version, Social Features" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/10/deezer-pulls-back-curtain-on-growth-strategy-launching-in-76-more-countries-adds-free-version-ramped-up-social-features/">announced</a> ambitious plans for growth today (off the back of a new $130 million <a title="French Music Startup Deezer Gets $130M Fourth Round, Led By Warner Music Group’s Owner Access Industries" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/06/deezer-raises-130-million-series-d-round-led-by-warner-music-groups-owner-access-industries/">funding round</a>), has chosen the U.K. startup <a target="_blank" href="http://www.songkick.com">Songkick</a> to power its concert recommendations.</p>
<p>The new feature was talked about at Deezer&#8217;s London press conference this morning, though the music streaming company was short on details, leading some news outlets to speculate that this put it in direct competition with Songkick and other concert recommendation sites and aggregators. That may be true for Songkick&#8217;s competitors &#8212; it claims to sit at number two behind only Ticketmaster &#8212; but isn&#8217;t the case for Songkick itself.</p>
<p>The tie-up with Deezer follows similar integrations with other music services, including being a launch partner when Deezer rival Spotify <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/30/spotify-platform/">unveiled</a> its own Spotify Apps platform, as Songkick continues its bid to put its concert listings data wherever music fans congregate online. Thus enabling artists to sell more tickets and merchandise, from which the startup also makes money.</p>
<p>Billed as &#8220;targeted concert listings&#8221;, Deezer users will now see relevant local concert listings based on their location and personal music library (e.g. playlists etc.), show up on their logged-in homepage. The new integration makes use of Songkick&#8217;s existing API for third-party developers.</p>
<p>In addition, Songkick is using the opportunity to flag up its recently launched Tourbox, a way for artists to take control of and manage their upcoming concert data on the service and across the sites and apps it powers &#8212; see previous TechCrunch <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/30/songkicks-tourbox-makes-it-easier-for-musicians-to-trumpet-their-concerts-across-the-web/">coverage</a>.</p>
<p>Of note, Songkick <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/08/songkick-secures-sequoias-first-ever-uk-investment-with-a-10m-b-round/">became Sequoia Capital’s first ever U.K. investment back in March</a>, bringing the startup&#8217;s total funding to around $17 million. Previous backers include Y Combinator, SoftTech, The Accelerator Group and Index Ventures.</p>
