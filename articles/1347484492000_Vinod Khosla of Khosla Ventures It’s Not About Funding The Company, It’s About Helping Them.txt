The two discussed Khosla&#8217;s perspective on how companies within his firm&#8217;s portfolios get the most out of working with the team. </p>
<p>Khosla is very passionate about assisting his companies with recruiting, even suggesting that talented folks send him their resume. Khosla went on to discuss what happens when you hire the wrong people, and he says that it&#8217;s hard to get a team back on track once those mistakes are made early on.</p>
<blockquote><p>I spend most of my time recruiting for my companies. You hire the first 15 people and they hire the rest.</p></blockquote>
<p>As Khosla discussed his practices, he says that it sets them apart from the rest of their competition. Khosla Ventures participates in way more than just investing and in many different verticals. Helping companies grow for success makes complete sense, since the firm gets to reap the rewards in the end&#8230;hopefully.</p>
<p>On Khosla&#8217;s investment on payment service Square:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you said to someone three years ago that you could compete against PayPal, most people would say that&#8217;s a crazy idea, payments are done.</p></blockquote>
