<p>Apple announced today on the company&#8217;s earnings call with investors and analysts that during its fiscal fourth quarter ended September 30 it set an all-time record for app sales. The company did not state the exact App Store revenue number for the quarter, but for context, the last time it revealed quarterly app store revenue numbers was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/24/apples-itunes-stores-generates-1-9b-in-revenue-in-q2-has-600000-apps/">after Q2 2012 when the company said</a> it made $1.9 billion in App Store sales. </p>
<p>The company now has more than 700,000 apps in its App Store, Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer said on the call, and 275,000 of those apps are built specifically for the iPad. The proceeds of the sales of those apps do not just benefit Apple &#8212; Oppenheimer said the company has now paid out more than $6.5 billion in cumulative payments to app developers since its App Store launched.</p>
<p>These latest numbers show that App Store growth is staying strong. In July at the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/24/apple-app-store-hits-650000-apps-250000-designed-for-ipad-5-5b-paid-out-to-devs/">close of its third fiscal quarter</a>, it had 650,000 total apps and had paid out $5.5 billion to developers.</p>
