In case you didn&#8217;t already have enough to ponder though, the folks behind the infamous <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/259238217470058496/photo/1">@evleaks</a> Twitter account have gotten their hands on yet another photo of the unreleased device and a few new particulars about its size and weight.</p>
<p>But first, the photo. In fairness, it&#8217;s far from the best Nexus 4 image I&#8217;ve seen out there &#8212; that distinction goes to the rather artsy photoset shot (see below) by <a target="_blank" href="http://tech.onliner.by/2012/10/12/lg-nexus-4-review">TechOnliner.ru</a> &#8212; but it matches up nicely with earlier leaks. Speaking of matching up, the device&#8217;s purported spec sheet (quad-core 1.5GHz APQ8064 chipset, 8-megapixel rear camera, 2GB of RAM, and a 4.7-inch display running at 1280&#215;768) is pretty much a direct translation of the components found in LG&#8217;s flagship Optimus G smartphone, again keeping with people&#8217;s prevailing notions about the device.</p>
<p>As has been pointed out more than a few times since the first Nexus 4 photos leaked, the device bears a striking resemblance to Samsung&#8217;s older Galaxy Nexus. Should @evleaks&#8217; info hold true though, LG&#8217;s device will be just a hair heftier than its Nexus predecessor: it weighs in at 139g and sports a 9.1mm waistline.</p>
<p>Naturally, neither LG or Google are willing to confirm the device&#8217;s existence just yet (hopefully someone in the process goofs the way printer RR Donnelly <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/18/googles-stock-takes-a-dive-after-mid-day-earnings-release-trading-halted/">did the other day</a>), but that could all change very shortly.  Google has already sent out invitations to an Android event on<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/17/google-issues-invites-to-october-29th-nyc-android-event-says-the-playground-is-open/"> October 29</a> that joyfully declares &#8220;the playground is open&#8221; &#8212; coupled with earlier reports that the next Nexus device (or device<strong>s</strong>; playgrounds can be pretty boring if you&#8217;re by yourself) would be unveiled <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/01/rumor-roundup-googles-new-nexus-phone-is-said-to-launch-this-month-but-which-one-is-it/">before the end of October</a>, it seems like Google is gearing up to steal Microsoft&#8217;s thunder with some hardware announcements of its own.</p>
