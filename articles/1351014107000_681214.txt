That&#8217;s pretty impressive and it&#8217;s about to get bigger. But smaller&#8230;due to the iPad Mini that&#8217;s about to be announced.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the things that is so rewarding to us is how quickly the iPad has been received in education&#8221; Cook shared.</p>
<p>The iPad isn&#8217;t just huge for mobile, it&#8217;s changing the computer industry as a whole:</p>

<p>What the iPad has done is make something that is super confusing and complex and turn it into something even a kid or older folk can handle. It&#8217;s huge for the web as well, as the iPad has outpaced every other tablet as far as web usage, according to Apple:</p>

<p>It&#8217;s huge in enterprise too, as its being used by 94% of Fortune 500 companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know we are just getting started&#8221; Cook said.</p>
<p>We sit here and wait for the iPad Mini to be announced, so <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/23/live-from-apples-san-jose-ipad-mini-event-at-10am-pacific1pm-eastern/">follow our liveblog</a>.</p>
