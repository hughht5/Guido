<p>Samsung loves to bash the iPhone and its legions of dedicated fans. And now Nokia has thrown down, too. </p>
<p>Nokia announced <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/05/nokia-lumia-920-official/">the stunning Lumia 920</a> last month. In several ways, it&#8217;s an anti-iPhone with a large screen, forward-thinking hardware features, and, yes like this ad brags, multiple color options. </p>
<p>For better or worse, phone manufacturers have turned to attacking the Apple and the iPhone rather than simply advertising their phones. </p>
<p>Verizon was <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnaAQwGcBks">very blunt</a> with its 2009 iDon&#8217;t DroidDoes ad campaign. Motorola poked fun at the mindless Apple fanboys in its 2011 Xoom Super Bowl commercial. Then, later that year, Samsung also made fun of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/09/samsung-galaxy-s-ii-ad-both-targets-and-mocks-apple-fanbois/">ignorant iPhone users</a>. Samsung <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/19/samsung-responds-to-iphone-5-frenzy-with-a-feisty-galaxy-s-iii-commercial/">revived the ad campaign</a> for the launch of the Galaxy S III, saying there&#8217;s no need to wait in line as the next big thing (the GSIII) is already here. This brings us to Nokia.</p>
<p>Nokia is in a tough spot. It needs a hit. This video just hit YouTube today. There&#8217;s no word if it will be aired on TV. But expect a major marketing push for the new Lumia phones. And for good reason, too. They&#8217;re fantastic.</p>
