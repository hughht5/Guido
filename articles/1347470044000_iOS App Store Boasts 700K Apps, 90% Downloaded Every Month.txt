Since this is a mobile-focused event, that&#8217;s the angle they chose to highlight, and the numbers around iPhone and iPad software were particularly impressive, starting with another App Store library milestone.</p>
<p>The App Store now plays host to 700,000 apps, (with 250,000 specifically for iPad) an increase of 100,000 from June,  and 90 percent of App Store&#8217;s apps are downloaded every month, and customers use more than 100 on average.</p>
<p>That marketplace services 400 million iOS devices, the number sold through June of this year.</p>
<p>Amazon played up its ecosystem at its press event detailing new Kindles last week, and this is a return volley. And a nice one, at that, delivering the message that when it comes to apps, Apple&#8217;s got the right formula while others are still looking for a way to somehow play catch-up.</p>
