And so it is that the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rocket-internet.de/">Samwer brothers</a>&#8216; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zalando.de/">Zalando</a>, which originally launched as a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/zappos">Zappos</a> clone but has since expanded from shoes into general fashion, has announced that it&#8217;s secured long-term debt financing of €40.7 million (approx. $52.6m), from Commerzbank, Sparkasse Mittelthüringen and KfW Bankengruppe. The new capital will be used to fund parts of the &#8220;interior fittings&#8221; of its new logistics centre as the company continues to gun for scale.</p>
<p>Of note, it <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/16/zalando-the-samwer-zappos-clone-closes-another-round-adds-jp-morgan-quadrant-capital-as-backers/">follows</a> another (undisclosed) round of funding, as recent as this August, that saw J.P. Morgan Asset Management and Quadrant Capital Advisors added to Zalando&#8217;s list of backers with each owning around 1% of the company.</p>
<p>Other investors in Zalando include the Samwer brothers’ Rocket Internet (owning 44%), Holtzbrinck Ventures (13%), Tengelmann Ventures (8%), Investment AB Kinnevik (16%) and DST Global (9%).</p>
<p>According to today&#8217;s press release, the construction site for the company&#8217;s 78,000 square meter warehouse in Erfurt opened in December 2011, while the extension to the building is expected to be completed in summer 2013. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the financing package ensures a &#8216;revolving credit facility&#8221; to support the company’s business operations.</p>
<p>Following a well trodden path, launched in 2008, Zalando has since expanded from shoes to more general fashion. Starting in its native market of Germany, the e-commerce site is now live in 12 markets and is set to add Poland and Norway to that list too. To service those multi-European markets, it needs a logistics base that scales &#8212; and today&#8217;s new debt financing should provide the capital needed to achieve that.</p>
