If you kindly recall Apple&#8217;s iPhone/iPod/iTunes announcement last month, you know that the fifth-gen iPod touch has quite the spec bump, but unfortunately is more difficult to repair than the fourth generation model.</p>
<p>In fact, it&#8217;s more difficult to repair than the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/22/fly-or-die-iphone-5/">iPhone 5</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone+5+Teardown/10525/1">by a lot</a>.</p>
<p>iFixit gave the music player a 3 out of 10 on the repairability scale, compared to the iPhone 5&#8242;s shocking 7 out of 10. For a little perspective, the fifth generation model scored one point less than the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPod+Touch+4th+Generation+Teardown/3562/3">fourth generation model</a>, which got a 4 out of 10.</p>
<p>Apparently dealing with the battery isn&#8217;t all that difficult, which is good news considering battery problems are relatively standard.</p>
<p>But iFixit says that Apple soldered many of the components together. And to top that off, there are no external screws on the device, but rather clips and adhesive. It&#8217;s a shame considering the iPod update cycle seems generally longer for most users.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, be careful when handling and try to avoid having to repair it altogether.</p>
<p>In related news, Apple recently launched a new iPod TV ad called <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/10/bounce-along-to-apples-latest-ipod-tv-ad/">Bounce</a>, featuring all three updated iPod products, including the touch, nano, and shuffle. Welcome to a world of color.</p>
