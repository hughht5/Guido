In the case of <a target="_blank" href="http://twelvesouth.com/products/hirise_imac/">Twelve South&#8217;s HiRise</a>, style meets functionality. See what I did there?</p>
<p>The HiRise is a little storage locker designed to sit under an iMac or Cinema Display. The front panel folds down, revealing an adjustable shelf and storage space large enough for even a Mac Mini. But that shelf &#8212; oh, Twelve South is so clever &#8212; allows the HiRise to display an iMac at the same height as a Cinema Display. </p>
<p>Clever or not, the HiRise is a bit pricey at $79.99. However, it fixes the common complaints about the iMac in that it sits too low and doesn&#8217;t naturally match the height of a Cinema Display. So rather than resorting to propping up an iMac with a phone book or reams of paper, iMac owners now have stylish and functional solution in the HiRise.</p>
<p>The HiRise is available now from TwelveSouth.com. It&#8217;s compatible with all Apple Displays and iMacs that use the L-shaped stand. </p>
