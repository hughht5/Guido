<p>According to the alleged document, notifications will be sent out to AT&amp;T customers on November 28th about the change in policy. Anyone suspected of engaging in illicit downloads will get an email alerting them to the possible copyright infringement. </p>
<p>There has been earlier evidence of a plan for a &#8216;six-stage&#8217; notification system. The document mentions this. Anyone continuing to access &#8220;many of the most frequently visited websites&#8221; will find their service restricted &#8211; that means blocking web sites.</p>
<p>People violating the terms will &#8211; at least according to this alleged document &#8211; end up needing to complete an online tutorial about copyright to have the restrictions to their service removed. There&#8217;s also a suggestion that the alerts may eventually result in a lawsuit.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that AT&amp;T is part of the MPAA and RIAA-backed Center for Copyright Information, and other members include Verizon, Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Cablevision. </p>
