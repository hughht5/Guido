The new co-designed <a target="_blank" href="http://generalassemb.ly/education/design-social-products/">curriculum</a> will teach aspiring developers how to develop social applications on the Facebook platform. &#8220;Facebook is happy to be working with General Assembly to help developers and would-be developers learn how to leverage the power of social,&#8221; they write in a statement to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The decision back in 2007 to allow developers to build applications, such as games and music services, for the social network is often hailed as a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2007/05/24/facebook-launches-facebook-platform-they-are-the-anti-myspace/">watershed moment</a> when Facebook pulled ahead of then-rival, Myspace. Since then, social apps have become a staple of social networking, from Facebook to Twitter and Google+.</p>
<p>While social applications have become big business, it is uncommon for a university to offer such industry-specific training. Indeed, Secretary of Education Arne DuncanÂ <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ctat.org/news-and-events/news/secretary-arne-duncan-affirms-cte-in-response-to-harvard-report/">once called</a> Career and Technical Education &#8220;the neglected stepchild of education reform.&#8221;</p>
<p>General Assembly has <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/19/ga-nyc-expansion/">experienced rapid expansion</a> from its New York Origins by wrapping startup-specific training from programming to management courses around a co-working space for technology startups. The new partnership with Facebook helps give this new educational alternative a big advantage over universities that have trouble keeping pace with rapid industry innovation.</p>
<p>For those interested in the class, tuition is $4,000, will take place in New York and London. In NYC, the course will go on from November 6 through January 29, and be taught by Peter Sullivan, the founder and CEO of social travel startup, Tripl.
