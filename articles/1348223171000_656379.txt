This morning &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.techbikers.com">Techbikers</a>&#8221; &#8211; 40 people from London’s tech community &#8211; will set out on a 200 mile cycle ride from Paris to London to raise money to build a library for children in the developing world. They are  first travelling to Paris on the Eurostar. From there they will cycle back to London &#8211; taking in 200 miles over 3 days. No mean feat. You can follow their progress on <a target="_blank" href="http://TechBikers.com">TechBikers.com</a>, live <a target="_blank" href="https://techbikers.jux.com/">photos here</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/techbikers">and donate here</a>. Go on!</p>
<p>The charity to benefit is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.roomtoread.org">Room to Read</a> which operates in India, Africa and Asia. Over 6 million children have been provided better access to education through Room to Read since 2000. The charity, which was Founded by a former Microsoft executive, John Wood who wrote the book “Leaving Microsoft to Change the World”, has built 1,592 schools and 13,170 libraries. </p>

<p>The TechBikers idea was the brainchild of <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/ediggs">Eze Vidra</a>, head of the Google-backed Campus London facility for startups, who was joined by co-orgnisers Gerry Newton, founder of <a target="_blank" href="http://bicyclebasecamp.com/">Cyclr</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://GroupSpaces.com">GroupSpaces</a> co-founder <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/Andyy">Andy Young</a>. Vidra told me he&#8217;d like to see other tech founders take up the idea and do something similar in their countries. </p>
<p>The group’s <a target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/techbikers">fundraising page</a> has now passed £16,000 and is aiming for £20,000, which may actually now be enough to build, staff and stock TWO libraries, serving up to 2,000 children.</p>
<p>The group has taken a very &#8216;tech&#8217; approach, creating a system for tracking donations in order to pit founders versus VCs, and has attracted <a target="_blank" href="http://techbikers.com/sponsors/">a lot of sponsors</a>. The sponsors are paying the costs of the trip, while  all the money donated online is going into the libraries.</p>
<p>The TechBikers will arrive to a celebration at Campus on their arrival Sunday evening. </p>
