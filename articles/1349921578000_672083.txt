<p>If iPods could dance, it would look a lot like this <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/videos/#tv-ad">new commercial</a> Apple has just posted to its website. The ad shows a plethora of colorful iPod touch, iPod nano, and iPod shuffles bouncing around. </p>
<p>In fact, the ad itself is called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Apple">&#8220;Bounce.&#8221;</a> </p>
<p>There&#8217;s plenty to be proud about with Apple&#8217;s latest generation iPods, especially the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/apple-outs-5th-generation-ipod-touch-with-4-inch-display-the-thinnest-6-1mm-and-lightest-88g-one-yet/">5th gen touch</a> with a 4-inch Retina display, Siri, and a more powerful A5 chipset. But in this ad, Apple&#8217;s chosen to go with color, as the entirely family of iPods now comes in a variety of color flavors. </p>
<p>Perhaps the next ads will focus on the<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/apple-announces-the-new-ipod-nano-2-5-display-home-button-38-thinner-7-colors/">iPod Nano</a>&#8216;s resurrected display or Siri&#8217;s presence on the all-new iPod touch. </p>
<p>For now, get down to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPukW1u7rPk">Willy Moon&#8217;s &#8220;Yeah Yeah&#8221;</a> and don&#8217;t forget to put a little bounce in your step. </p>
