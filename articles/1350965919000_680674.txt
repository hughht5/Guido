Because, as we shuffed out of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.girlswhocode.com/">Girls Who Code</a> event held there earlier tonight, we looked at the jumble of computers and stock tickers on the first floor of 18 Bond Street and exclaimed in awe, &#8220;So this is where it all goes down, huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>And of course, because we&#8217;re tech people and troublemakers we&#8217;re like, &#8220;So how does it work?&#8221; specifically joking, in light of all the recent tech stock collapses, &#8220;Which one of these do I have to spill water on (okay, we may have said wine) to make people irrationally buy Facebook?&#8221;</p>
<p>The founder and I (who made me promise not to write about him/her because he/she said his/her <del>parents </del>PR people would kill him/her and I don&#8217;t want to be an accomplice to murder) took solace in this laughter, and the idea that the rise in price of $FB shares would most likely bolster the entire tech industry.</p>
<p>And all was bright and shiny until an NYSE security guard pulled the founder aside from our revelry. &#8220;Excuse me sir/mam, did you just ask which computer you&#8217;d have to spill water (okay, it was most likely wine) on to make people buy Facebook stock?&#8221; Oh God.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were joking,&#8221; I replied, which, like how you can&#8217;t <a target="_blank" href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080802095208AAyj87V">say bomb</a> in any context on a plane, apparently isn&#8217;t acceptable in the NYSE. Because we got kicked out. &#8220;Get OUT&#8221; the guard said, and we scurried out, because he really did mean it. One man&#8217;s facetiousness is another man&#8217;s terrorist threat. And yes, I have the utmost respect for this guard. Because this exactly was his job.</p>
<p>So we got OUT, like ran out, before the man could take further action, and I hope we&#8217;re not banned for life because I have to be at an another event at the NYSE on Thursday. Also, Girls Who Code is awesome, and you should all download 16-year-old <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/n4smily">Nikita Rau&#8217;s</a> app Wander. And not joke about destroying important things, ever. Pro tip.</p>
