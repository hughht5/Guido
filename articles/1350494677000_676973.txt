For me, it&#8217;s animated GIFs, hilarious posts and a killer community. The company, founded by CEO Jonah Peretti, is on a mission to create its own vertical as a publication, and has taken a step today to grow even more. BuzzFeed has hired former <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fins.com">FINS</a> Director of Product Management, Dao Nguyen, as its &#8220;Director of Growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>What does that title mean? Well basically, she&#8217;s going to come in and build traffic by helping readers find the content that they want to read. That sounds pretty simple, but it&#8217;s not. BuzzFeed has grown dramatically since it launched, and continues to carve out its special place on the web. Personally, I have the site open in a tab all day.</p>

Nguyen was also a CEO of a news site, knows how to code and she has an extensive mathematical background.</p>
<p>BuzzFeed tells me that:</p>
<blockquote><p>Every publisher will have someone like this in a year or two. </p></blockquote>
<p>And I agree.</p>

<p>The company has raised $27M to date, with its <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/09/viral-aggregator-buzzfeed-raises-15-5m-to-transform-the-way-people-get-their-news/">latest massive funding round coming in January</a>.</p>
<p>What can we expect from BuzzFeed in the future? Well, we&#8217;ll have to wait and see. I expect great things, and I think it&#8217;s an amazing move for the company, even though it&#8217;s incredibly forward thinking. Hats off to BuzzFeed for seeing into the future with all of us. Welcome to our world, Dao.</p>
