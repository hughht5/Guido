<p>That was pretty well summed up today when SAP&#8217;s Sethu Meenakshisundaram said the client/server is back and it is cloud. It&#8217;s such a curious analogy and a vexing one for most of the people I know and talk to every day. But on a practical level It shows how SAP is trying bridge two worlds by using the client/server metaphor as a comparison to today&#8217;s modern services that the company is trying to embrace.</p>
<p>Meenakshisundaram said the client/server analogy to the cloud encompass dimensions such as communications, deployment and domain expertise. Cloud is a deployment model. Apps are deployed to the cloud as much as they are to on-premise servers. Cloud is a communications model driven by RESTful APIs.  And there are domain specific cloud environments.</p>
<p>But, oh, how confusing it can be. It felt like the B.S. meter was at full tilt this morning or perhaps it was just muddled thinking. But then again, as <a target="_blank" href="http://redmonk.com/jgovernor/">James Governor</a> said, at least SAP is not making up some new term. </p>
<p>What we are really seeing is a company trying to get an understanding of a new reality. It&#8217;s not just cloud versus client/server. It&#8217;s about what it means to be an enterprise software company in age when most developers are thinking about a new infrastructure and not what it compares to the ways of managing applications.</p>
