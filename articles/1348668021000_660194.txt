The changes should make it a little more clear that Vibrant&#8217;s in-text ads are indeed ads, while also giving advertisers the opportunity to deliver something a little more splashy.</p>
<p>CEO Cella Irvine showed me some quick demos of the redesigned ads last week. She says the redesign falls into three general areas — moving beyond &#8220;highlighted keywords&#8221; to &#8220;user notification,&#8221; &#8220;in-context&#8221; advertising, and moving beyond Vibrant&#8217;s standard ad unit to &#8220;an array of solutions.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the user notification side, there have been some nice, if relatively subtle (hey, there&#8217;s not much room to work with) changes to the way that the links to Vibrant&#8217;s ads show up in the text. Instead of just underlining and highlighting relevant words in green, there&#8217;s a now a small icon next to the link. Then, once you hover over the ad (if you&#8217;re on a desktop) or tap on it (if you&#8217;re on a tablet), it actually flips over to show the advertiser&#8217;s logo and company/product name right before the ad itself appears. In some cases, there&#8217;s also a countdown before the ad appears, so you can move the mouse cursor away if, for example, you don&#8217;t actually want a video to start playing.</p>
<p>From the consumer side, that should cut down on moments where you accidentally hover over a link, then think, &#8220;Wait, what just happened?&#8221; That&#8217;s probably better for advertisers, too, especially since they get to show a little more branding in the process. You can <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vibrantmedia.com/thenewintext">watch a demo of the redesigned links here</a>.</p>

<p>Vibrant is also launching a new Mosaic ad unit, which is a full-screen, interactive experience. Again, Vibrant started out by offering its ads in a relatively small window. But now that it&#8217;s giving users more warning about what they&#8217;re getting into, it&#8217;s also offering advertisers an opportunity to get a little more aggressive. That means there are now three in-text units that advertisers can choose from — the initial 300 x 250 pixel ad unit, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/03/vibrant-media-lightbox/">the Lightbox video format (announced earlier this year)</a>, and the new Mosaic.</p>
<p>As for the idea of &#8220;in-context&#8221; advertising, Irvine means that Vibrant should deliver relevant ads in a number of different contexts, not just in-text. The company already offers display and in-image ads (and it <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/19/vibrant-media-image-space-acquisition/">acquired Image Space Media</a> earlier this year to expand those efforts). Lightbox videos already work in the image ads, and the company says Mosaic units will be added soon.</p>
<p>Vibrant says it now works with 6,500 publishers and reaches more than 300 million unique users per month.</p>
