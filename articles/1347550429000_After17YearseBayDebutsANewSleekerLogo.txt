The colors of the logo are the same, but the font is a bit more modern and sleek, and the word &#8220;eBay&#8221; is cleanly aligned in a straight line.</p>
<p>As Devin Wenig, president of eBay, writes in a release, <em>Our refreshed logo is rooted in our proud history and reflects a dynamic future. It’s eBay today: a global online marketplace that offers a cleaner, more contemporary and consistent experience, with innovation that makes buying and selling easier and more enjoyable. We retained core elements of our logo, including our iconic color palette. Our vibrant eBay colors and touching letters represent our connected and diverse eBay community – more than 100 million active users and 25 million sellers globally and growing.</em></p>
<p>He said that as the marketplace evolved, it was time for the branding and logo to change, too. As we <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/18/ebay-beats-forecasts-on-strong-marketplace-growth-q2-revenue-up-23-percent-to-3-4b/">heard in July</a>, eBay&#8217;s mobile apps have been downloaded 100 million times, and the company expects more than $10 billion in volume transacted via mobile this year. And the marketplace is seeing 260 million searches a day, with 350 million product listings on the site.</p>
<p>The new logo will begin to appear across eBay sites and channels this fall.</p>
<p>Wenig notes that, while &#8220;auction listings remain an important part of the business today, most items sold on eBay are new, listed at a fixed “Buy It Now!” price.&#8221;</p>
<p>eBay has been trying to evolve into a multi-platform commerce giant beyond just the marketplace and has made a big bet on mobile, both in its marketplace and through PayPal. Via <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/06/ebay-acquires-style-focused-social-curated-shopping-site-svpply/">acquisitions like Svvply</a> and Hunch, eBay is also trying its hand at providing a more personalized and curated experience for consumers.</p>
