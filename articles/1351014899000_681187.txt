Even though the screen is smaller, Apple kept the same 4:3 aspect ratio. That is why iPad mini apps will simply be shrunk down versions of iPad apps. As the iPad mini uses the same resolution as the non-retina iPads, iOS will use 1x graphics.</p>
<p>Even though buttons will be smaller, if developers are already following Apple&#8217;s Human Interface Guidelines, that shouldn&#8217;t be a problem. The HIG recommends bigger buttons for the iPad than for the iPhone. Shrunk down buttons should approximately be the size of iPhone buttons.</p>
<p>Of course, if developers didn&#8217;t follow the guidelines in the first place, they will have some work to do to make their apps usable on an iPad mini. But there won&#8217;t be another category of apps in the App Store.</p>
