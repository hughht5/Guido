Finally, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2012-10/light-focusing-contact-lenses-reshape-childrens-eyes-preventing-nearsightedness">there may be a cure for nearsightedness</a> (&#8220;Myopia&#8221;) on horizon. Biomedical scientist David Trolio has experimented with a new contact lens that prevents the eye from malforming at a young age in the first place, by refocusing light as it hits the eye. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gizmag.com/myopia-stopping-contact-lenses/24407/">He and his</a> colleagues at State University of New York (SUNY) College of Optometry &#8220;successfully reduced the elongation of the eye that causes myopia progression.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eyeglasses work by refocusing light onto the retina, the light-sensitive tissue in the back of the eye responsible for transforming photons of light into signals the brain can turn into images. Unfortunately, the bending of the light isn&#8217;t perfect, and the eye ends up elongating in compensating even more to make up for the difference, exacerbating the Myopia. &#8220;The experimental lenses use different focal powers within a single lens: either alternating focal powers across the lens, or confined to the outer edge,&#8221; <a target="_blank" href="http://phys.org/news/2012-10-specialty-contact-lenses-day-halt.html">reports</a> Pys.org.</p>
<p>Details are scant on the new technology, but Trolio hopes that the contact lens will be available for young patients soon.</p>
