Editor Tina Brown describes this move, which will take place at year&#8217;s end, as &#8220;embracing the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>I should hope so.</p>
<p>Whither Newsweek goes, the rest of the magazine industry will go. I&#8217;m an infrequent paper magazine reader &#8211; I buy them before flights so I have something to look at before I can turn on my tablet at 32,000 feet &#8211; and I&#8217;ve found that my absolute favorite magazines, the New Yorker and the Economist, have weathered the transition to digital quite well. Comically, both maintain advertiser-rich print editions that presumably buoy finances. I worry, however, that magazines like Time and Rolling Stone will survive with far less success, although there are a few potential silver linings in this beclouded sky.</p>
<p>First, there are the naysayers. Felix Salmon says the whole idea is risible (but then again isn&#8217;t Reuters a primarily online effort that is essentially kept afloat by business subscribers?) and that no one will write for or buy the paywalled Newsweek when Brown&#8217;s The Daily Beast is a click away. <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2012/10/18/why-keep-newsweek-on-life-support/">He writes</a>:</p>
<div style="margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px;padding-left:15px;border-left:3px solid #ccc;font-style:italic;">The chances that Newsweek will succeed as a digital-only subscription-based publication are exactly zero. If you had a team of first-rate technologists and start from scratch trying to create such a beast, you’d end up with something pretty much like Huffington — which lasted exactly five issues before bowing to the inevitable and going free. There’s no demand for a digital Newsweek, and there’s no reason, either, to carve off some chunk of the NewsBeast newsroom, call it “Newsweek”, and put its journalism onto a platform where almost nobody is going to read it.</div>
<p>While I would argue that services like the Daily &#8211; aimed at red-suspendered traders interested in sports news and news bits on their way to work from the wilds of New Jersey &#8211; are still in their infancy, the general consensus is that the paywall, like it or not, will have to exist for the magazine industry to survive.</p>
<p>According to best estimates, the print magazine industry is winding down. This year 181 titles launched and 61 titles closed. Newsweek&#8217;s own subscription base was stable, dropping 9% since 2006. 1.1 million people expected the magazine to pop up in their mailboxes weekly, a number bolstered by subscription deals that were often too good to be true. One deal I found offered 54 issues for $39, valuing the individual magazine at 72 cents.</p>
<p>Would you buy digital Newsweek, then, for the same 72 cents? First, Tina Brown isn&#8217;t asking you, educated and highly literate Internaut with a Flipboard catalog full of obscure RSS feeds. She&#8217;s asking an older generation just getting acquainted with digital media to do this and it&#8217;s my wager that they will.</p>
<p>We are, in short, in an era of media transition. Newsweek can survive in this era because it is a trusted brand that can exist outside of the fast-moving bubble of blogs and &#8220;web properties.&#8221; In the Venn diagram of Newsweek readers and, say, TechCrunch readers I would expect the overlap to be minor. The new Newsweek is aiming at less-savvy yet news-hungry readers whose subscriptions have been grandfathered over to their iPads. Those 1.1 million subscribers will receive a renewal notice, understand when their Newsweek app has been updated with new content, and will be happy to read whatever the heck Newsweek writes about these days. It&#8217;s a brand they trust.</p>
<p>The reason piracy is, in fact, rare is that it&#8217;s hard. Being a pirate &#8211; or at least figuring out the vagaries of ThePirateBay &#8211; are a young person&#8217;s game. The Kindle is popular because it reduces the friction of buying books to almost piracy-slick levels. Whereas the pirate revels in the smooth transition from link to content, the Kindle user revels in the smooth transition from &#8220;Buy This&#8221; to reading.</p>
<p>We constantly expect no one to pay for anything. That is not the case. People will pay because it&#8217;s easier than not paying. Here&#8217;s hoping that Newsweek, once one of my favorite magazines if only for the jolly front page full of quips and editorial cartoons, can bridge that chasm. If they can&#8217;t, they&#8217;ll sink, just as so many magazines will in the next few years.</p>
