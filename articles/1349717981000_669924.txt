In addition, purchases users have made on other supported devices will also be available on Google TV following this update.</p>
<p>The new content will be included in the Google Play store&#8217;s &#8220;TV &amp; Movies&#8221; app, which also houses competing offerings from both Amazon and Netflix, as well as content recommendations. While more content is the big news for Google&#8217;s consumer install base, which <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/13/majority-of-google-tv-app-install-base-from-pre-loads/">earlier this year</a> was <a target="_blank" href="http://gigaom.com/video/google-tv-number-of-active-devices/">estimated</a> at less than 1 million, the update also brings a number of new features for developers, too. Specifically, developers will now gain access to auto-updates, subscription billing, and smart app updates, the company <a target="_blank" href="http://googletv.blogspot.com/2012/10/google-play-movies-tv-shows-and-music.html">announced</a> via blog post.</p>
<p>While Google didn&#8217;t provide details as to the exact size of its catalog, it said that it includes &#8220;millions&#8221; of songs and &#8220;thousands&#8221; of movie and TV shows. <a target="_blank" href="http://googletv.blogspot.com/2012/06/more-entertainment-choices-with-google.html">A few months ago</a>, that catalog included 100,000 TV episodes and movies.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a tough year for Google TV, which didn&#8217;t even get a shout-out during Google&#8217;s Â I/O conference this time around, and whose hardware partners have been <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/13/majority-of-google-tv-app-install-base-from-pre-loads/">suffering</a> from a lack of sales. But in June, Google <a target="_blank" href="http://googletv.blogspot.com/2012/06/more-entertainment-choices-with-google.html">announced</a> support for the Google Play store on Google TV, promising movies, music and TV would be &#8220;coming soon.&#8221; October, apparently, is what it meant by soon? The update is rolling out starting today, and will continue to hit devices over the next few weeks.</p>
