The traditional process involves filling out an online form on AT&amp;T&#8217;s website, sending a fax (yes, a fax) to AT&amp;T, waiting 5 to 7 days and restoring your phone. It turns out that it is much easier than that: just restore the phone in iTunes and it will be unlocked.</p>
<p>We have confirmed the process with AT&amp;T&#8217;s technical support and successfully tried it with a T-Mobile SIM card. After restoring the device in iTunes, the user is prompted with the usual unlocking message: &#8220;Congratulations, your iPhone has been unlocked.&#8221;</p>
<p>This message wasn&#8217;t enough for me though. I need more proof that I could use the iPhone on every carrier and abroad.</p>
<p>After receiving the notification my new iPhone was unlocked, I cut a micro-SIM card into the shape of a nano-SIM by using the AT&amp;T SIM card that was already in the iPhone 5 as a guide. The most difficult part was to make it narrower so that you can close the tiny nano-SIM tray, though some have reported that this step may be optional.</p>
<p>In a couple of seconds, the iPhone was able to pick up the T-Mobile network, and calls and EDGE data connectvity worked as expected. Some <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/LTEstyles/status/250675552317480960">reports</a>, including on <a target="_blank" href="http://forums.att.com/t5/Apple-Community-Discussion/Can-I-unlock-Iphone-5-if-I-bought-it-with-no-contract/td-p/3308331">AT&amp;T forum</a>, confirm this.</p>
<p>When you buy an iPhone, the device is added to Apple&#8217;s big iPhone database thanks to the IMEI, which is used as a unique identifier. Full price and subsidized iPhone 5 models apparently don&#8217;t have the same status in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cultofmac.com/89968/company-will-unlock-your-iphone-forever-by-hacking-into-apples-whitelist/">the database</a> as it is flagged as &#8220;ready to be unlocked&#8221; when purchased without a contract.</p>
<p>The iPhone 5 we tested was bought in an Apple retail store, but we couldn&#8217;t confirm this with another, pre-ordered iPhone 5 &#8212; even though the device was purchased at full price, it was tied to an existing AT&amp;T account during the pre-order process. The carrier clearly states on its website that you have to be either a former customer or a customer without contract obligations to be eligible to go through the entire process, fax included. It could be problematic as well if you bought your iPhone 5 directly from AT&amp;T.</p>
