Between the announcements of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/apple-iphone-5-official/">the iPhone 5</a> and the updated <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/apple-announces-the-new-ipod-nano-2-5-display-home-button-38-thinner-7-colors/">iPod</a> <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/apple-outs-5th-generation-ipod-touch-with-4-inch-display-the-thinnest-6-1mm-and-lightest-88g-one-yet/">line-up</a>, it is hard to keep track of all the details. It is now time to look back and read our coverage of what Apple showed to the press today.</p>
<h4>The iPhone 5</h4>
<p>Of course, the biggest announcement was the unveiling of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/apple-iphone-5-official/">the iPhone 5</a>. The rumors were true — the device sports a 4-inch display, comes with a new dock connector called <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/the-iphone-5-comes-with-the-new-lightning-connector/">Lightning</a> (<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/apple-offers-lightning-to-30-pin-adapters-for-29-and-39-both-ship-in-october/">adapters</a> are available), <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/the-iphone-5-comes-with-ultra-fast-wireless-lte-around-the-world-and-802-11n-dual-channel-wi-fi/">LTE and 802.11n</a> dual-channel 5GHz Wi-Fi and a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/apples-new-nano-sim-freeing-up-valuable-space-inside-the-case/">nano-SIM slot</a>.</p>
<p>It will be available on <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/iphone-5-pricing-and-availability-revealed-199-for-16gb-299-for-32gb-399-for-64gb/">September 21</a> for $199 for 16GB, $299 for 32GB or $399 for 64GB — pre-orders open <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/the-apple-store-is-back-up-pre-order-iphone-5-for-199-up/">on Friday</a>.

<p></p>
<h4>New iPod Touch</h4>
<p>The iPod Touch was updated as well to keep the device on par with the latest iPhone. It uses the same 4-inch screen and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/apple-shows-off-virtual-pet-clumsy-ninja-to-demo-new-ipod-touchs-gaming-power/">powerful system on a chip</a> but is at the same time the thinnest and lightest iPod Touch ever produced. Like the iPod Nano, the device now comes with several color options — grey, black, blue, green, and red.

<p></p>
<h4>New iPod nano</h4>
<p>The iPod nano was updated as well with a bigger screen. Once again, the iPod nano is Apple&#8217;s playground for testing new designs. They are not afraid of changing everything with each generation.

<p></p>
<h4>EarPods</h4>
<p>EarPods are the new Apple earbuds. An update was highly overdue and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/apple-fixes-its-headphone-problem-with-new-earpods-shipping-today/">it&#8217;s available now</a>.

<h4>Software</h4>
<p>iOS 6 will be available for iPhone and iPod Touch owners on September 19. Even though we already knew a lot about the new operating system, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/apples-ios-6-facebook-maps-passbook-photo-sharing-siri-and-more/">new features</a> were announced, such as <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/apple-shows-off-panoramic-photos-better-photo-sharing-in-new-iphone/">panoramic photos</a> and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/apple-shows-off-time-shifted-gamecenter-multiplayer-with-real-racing-3/">time-shifted GameCenter</a>. But the most important changes are <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/with-new-ios-6-app-store-the-most-important-changes-are-under-the-hood/">under the hood</a>. Unoptimized apps will <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/first-party-apple-apps-optimized-for-iphone-5-display-existing-apps-will-run-letterboxed/">run letterboxed</a>.

<h4>Numbers</h4>
<p>As with every keynote, Apple gave us a few impressive numbers to make the company shine. It sold <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/the-post-pc-era-apple-announces-steller-ipad-sales-numbers-84m-sold/">84 million</a> iPads, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/apple-has-sold-over-400-million-ios-devices-9-5-growth-since-march/">400 million</a> iOS devices and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/apple-is-number-1-in-u-s-notebook-sales/">more laptops</a> than any other manufacturer. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/apple-retail-380-stores-83-million-visitors-last-quarter/">83 million</a> people visited at least one of the 380 Apple retail stores in the world. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/ios-app-store-boasts-700k-apps-90-downloaded-every-month/">700,000</a> apps are now available in the App Store. Even more important, 90 percent of them are downloaded every month.</p>
