<p>VP of Marketing Mike Markson describes this as a way for people to showcase their knowledge in a given field, without actually having to constantly hunt down new content. For example, EarthEcho, the environmental nonprofit founded by Philippe and Alexandra Cousteau, has <a target="_blank" href="http://earthecho.org/rockzi">embedded a ROCKZi board</a> that highlights marine science and conservation news.</p>
<p>To set up a ROCKZi embed, you first create a standard ROCKZi board, which is a pretty simple process. You just enter the topic, then ROCKZi automatically starts pulling in related news. Anyone can upvote good stories by hitting the &#8220;this rockz&#8221; button, and they can submit stories of their own. As the board creator, you can also delete stories that aren&#8217;t a good fit.</p>
<p>When you embed a board, you can customize its look to match your own site. And if someone shares a board on Facebook or Twitter, it directs traffic to your site, not ROCKZi.</p>
<p>Visitors can also search the content of any specific board. Markson says this also has the effect of &#8220;unboxing search&#8221; — instead of conducting a searching the web through a general service Google (or Blekko), you can narrow your focus to results in a given topic, with content that has been curated by someone who is (hopefully) an expert in that area.</p>
<p>&#8220;As people start creating boards around topics, I think it&#8217;s bringing search away from an algorithm, back to the tastemakers,&#8221; Markson says. &#8220;It&#8217;s a more preferable way to access information.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sites that are already have their own embedded ROCKZi boards include <a target="_blank" href="http://beatsforboobs.org/content/news/">cancer fundraiser Beats for Boobs</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.guitarshoptv.com/news/">Guitar Shop TV</a>,  and <a target="_blank" href="http://photodrug.com/">Photodrug</a>.</p>
<p>Markson says that ROCKZi itself has been doing well since launch, with 2 million page views. The average time spent on site is five minutes, with a 65 percent return rate.</p>
