So-called &#8220;Biofeedback&#8221; displays students&#8217; brainwaves in realtime and alerts them when they&#8217;ve dropped into a state of calm focus. &#8220;Once a student learns to reduce their anxiety using skills learned through biofeedback training, their performance increases significantly — often resulting in dramatic improvements in academic performance,&#8221; says U of Iowa Counselor and clinical psychologist, Jeffrey Ellen.</p>
<p>Biofeedback, or the modern cognitive application, Neurofeedback, was developed in the late 1960&#8242;s out of the University of California, Los Angeles and has been <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/05/health/05neurofeedback.html?pagewanted=all">slowly creeping into the mainstream</a> to treat everyone from Iraq vets with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder to middle-schoolers with Attention Deficit Disorder.</p>
<p>Our brains exude readable output of electromagnetic radiation (waves); over the decades, cognitive scientists have matched patterns of thought to particular brainwaves. When jittery students are hooked up to the device, the computer recognizes the hyper-active state and can alert them via graphics and sounds as they consciously become more relaxed. The result is a kind-of guided meditation, with a computer guru that is physically aware of precise brain states. &#8220;I really want to focus on my senior year, and I’ve been really stressed out. Everything building up, and I just felt like I need to get some guidance. My professor brought me to realize that there is a program that’s out there that can help me,” said Iowa student and first time Biofeedback participant, Sarah Bishop.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/05/health/05neurofeedback.html?pagewanted=all">Neurofeedback</a> is not an accepted dogma in all medical circles. The relatively new science is still being evaluated by more advanced double-blind research and in a greater variety of cases. Despite the newness, Iowa has seen a three-fold increase in demand (429 students) in just a year and the fact that it&#8217;s being officially sanctioned by a university speaks highly of this space-age therapy.</p>
