The owners of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.veoh.com">Veoh</a>, a video portal that claims to have millions of users worldwide, has said it has enlisted the help of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.equitypartnersCRB.com">Equity Partners CRB</a> to explore strategic options for the company, including a sale. &#8220;The company intends to focus solely on commercialization of its proprietary social video offerings,&#8221; it said in a statement (embedded below). The move is a sign that even with large audiences (but perhaps not large enough) video portals are facing some challenges monetizing under their existing, ad-based business models.</p>
<p>Veoh, which focuses on premium rather than user-generated content, says it currently has 3 million pieces of content in its catalog, along with revenue-sharing partnerships with  TV, cable, music and other brands worldwide. The company had raised some $80 million from investors that include Intel Capital and Michael Eisner.</p>

<p><strong>VIDEO PORTAL SITE RETAINS M&amp;A FIRM, EQUITY PARTNERS CRB</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SEPTEMBER 11, 2012 – LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA &#8212; The owners of Veoh, one of the world&#8217;s largest video portals (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.veoh.com/">www.veoh.com</a>) has retained Equity Partners CRB (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.equitypartnerscrb.com/">www.equitypartnersCRB.com</a>) to explore strategic options, including a sale of the asset.<br />
Veoh has millions of users from around the world, including large communities in Asia, America and Europe, and a quickly growing community in India, as well as over a million mobile users.</p>
<p>Hundreds of Veoh servers, located in southern California, accommodate a global audience hungry for video, along with storage capabilities for user generated content and media partner content, robust technology for ad serving and partner management, as well as over 3 million pieces of content on the system.  Veoh enjoys revenue partnerships with TV, cable, music and online video brands all over the world. Operating costs have been trimmed to create one of the most efficient video operations active today.<br />
Veoh was originally purchased as a source of traffic for a new social video technology start up in 2009 from a founding team which had invested nearly $80 million in building a world class video portal and included marquee investors like Michael Eisner and Intel Capital.   Now that Veoh has served this purpose well, the company intends to focus solely on commercialization of its proprietary social video offerings.<br />
The sales process is being represented by Equity Partners.  Matt LoCascio, a Managing Director at EP, says that “is a very unique opportunity to capture massive traffic and a sophisticated technology backbone that can be used for a variety of video, social, and gaming applications.”</p>
<p>Equity Partners CRB, headquartered in Easton, Maryland, provides investment banking services exclusively for middle market companies in financial distress and/or with special purpose assets and has completed in excess of 400 transactions throughout the United States since 1988.</p></blockquote>
