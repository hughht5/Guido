<p>Coterie allows women to sign up for exclusive limited deals on beauty brands like Kevyn Aucoin and Butter London, &#8220;All of our offers are exclusive collections, meaning you can&#8217;t get them anywhere else,&#8221; co-founder Catherine Magee tells me, &#8220;All the new and best products, not excess or discontinued inventory.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company will eventually let customers subscribe to their favorite Coterie-featured beauty products via its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.coterie.com/my-vanity">&#8220;My Vanity&#8221;</a> feature. &#8220;My Vanity,&#8221; which will roll out in three weeks, allows customers to track follow brands and subscribe to beauty products they need replenished.</p>
<p>Magee views the company as competitive with Sephora and Beauty Bar, but holds that the &#8220;My Vanity&#8221; feature, site creative and the personalization of the shopping experience is what sets the startup apart from the incumbents.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the biggest challenges prestige brands have today is that their online retailer partners can not articulate the product attributes and brand story necessary to sell a prestige beauty product,&#8221; says Magee, &#8220;With Coterie, brands finally can introduce a new product with the same visual and brand experience consumers get from the offline.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup plans on using the cash to hire more engineers to foster a technology-driven culture and (of course) scale.</p>
