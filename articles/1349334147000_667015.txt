But it&#8217;s true: despite all the work Rovio (and others that Rovio <a target="_blank" href="http://paidcontent.org/2011/06/08/419-angry-birds-is-prepping-its-first-book-a-cookbook-about-eggs/">seems to tolerate happily</a>) has put into spinning out its wildly successful mobile game about catapulting birds onto structures made by pigs, the company has never produced an official book app.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all changing come next week, when Rovio will unveil its first effort into the e-book app market. And it&#8217;s choosing one of the biggest events on the publishing world calendar &#8212; the Frankfurt Book Fair &#8212; to unveil it.</p>
<p>The invitation, as you can see below, doesn&#8217;t give a huge amount away. What we can see is that it&#8217;s not clearly branded Angry Birds, but we do have a lot of pig heads piled up. But that could also be just a bit of opportunistic cross marketing: right now Rovio is hard at work promoting another product, the new game Bad Piggies, even giving over the home page of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybirds.com">Angry Birds URL</a> to the purpose.</p>
<p>What will be interesting to see is how Rovio flies the &#8220;book app&#8221; format: there have been e-books that are effectively facsimiles of printed books; and mobile apps that are games and clearly not books. Where book apps really stand out is when they combine a reading (often word-based) narrative with lots of interactivity, something that Rovio very much does well. It&#8217;s been something used a lot in non-fiction book apps but you can see how a &#8216;choose your own adventure&#8217; format, for example, could work really well here.</p>
<p>There have been some who have argued that <a target="_blank" href="http://dearauthor.com/ebooks/the-biggest-threat-to-publishing-isnt-amazon-its-angry-birds-why-publishers-should-invest-in-libraries/">Angry Birds poses the biggest threat to the publishing industry</a>. Let&#8217;s see what kind of reception the Mighty Eagle and his crew get next week.</p>
