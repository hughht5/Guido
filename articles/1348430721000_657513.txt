<p>The government said that it&#8217;s going to launch its own domestic Internet, and that the system will be fully operational by March 2013, according to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/23/net-us-iran-internet-national-idUSBRE88M0AO20120923">Reuters</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.techmeme.com/120923/p9#a120923p9">others</a> (who, in turn, seem to be basing their reports on the Iranian media). It&#8217;s not clear whether all access to sites outside of Iran will be blocked once the domestic system is live.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity is the official reason for the growing online restrictions (sites like YouTube and Facebook are already blocked), but it&#8217;s probably not coincidental that the Internet was also seen as a key tool in 2009&#8242;s protests against President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. (The importance of tools like Facebook and Twitter in those protests has been <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/10/04/101004fa_fact_gladwell?currentPage=all">the subject of some debate</a>.) Iranians &#8220;commonly&#8221; get around the existing government filters by using VPN software, Reuters says.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the Washington Post <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/iran-preparing-internal-version-of-internet/2012/09/19/79458194-01c3-11e2-b260-32f4a8db9b7e_story_1.html">reported</a> that an Iranian domestic Internet system was in the works, giving the government more power to restrict online access during protests or other periods of civil unrest. However, planning such a system and actually making it work are two different things â€” a retired security director from the National Security Agency told the Post that &#8220;any attempt by a country to make an intranet is doomed to failure.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Iranian government also announced, via state television, that it will be blocking accessing to Google and Gmail within &#8220;a few hours.&#8221; The Iranian Students&#8217; News Agency says this is in response to the anti-Islamic &#8220;Innocence of Muslims Video&#8221; that was posted (<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/17/why-google-shouldnt-have-censored-the-anti-islamic-video/">and then blocked</a>) on YouTube. I&#8217;ve emailed Google for more information and will update if I hear back.</p>
