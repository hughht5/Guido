That&#8217;s bound to be a drool-worthy camera, and this might represent the perfect storm of tech design fanboyism.</p>
<p>No details about what the new Leica will look like or whether it&#8217;ll differ considerably from its stock base model, but only one will ever exist, and that&#8217;s likely enough to get the kind of people who can afford this sort of thing salivating. The single edition will be auctioned off, with all proceeds going to charity.</p>
<p>The new <a title="Leica Drops Five New Cameras, Each (Not Surprisingly) Both Gorgeous And Pricey" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/17/leica-drops-five-new-cameras-each-not-surprisingly-both-gorgeous-and-pricey/">Leica M, unveiled yesterday</a>, offers a 24MP full 35mm format CMOS sensor, and introduces 1080p full HD video capability to the M line. Presumably the specs will remain unchanged on the Ive-designed version, but that&#8217;s not really what one lucky rich person&#8217;s going to be paying for here. For those of us stuck looking at even the Leica M not designed by a British knight as little more than a fantasy, there&#8217;s always another, much more affordable way to mash up your love for Apple with your love for Leica: <a target="_blank" href="http://store.petapixel.com/products/Leica-Look%252dAlike-Skin-for-the-iPhone-4.html">This sticker</a>, which hopefully gets an upgrade for the iPhone 5 soon.</p>
