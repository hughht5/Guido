<p>The new store opening is timed coincidentally around the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/14/iphone-5-pre-order-sells-out-20x-faster-than-4-and-4s-further-highlighting-apples-dominance/" title="iPhone 5 Pre-order Sells Out 20X Faster Than 4 And 4S, Further Highlighting Apple’s Dominance">launch of the iPhone 5</a>, but when that device hits shelves next Friday, September 21, the newest Apple Store won&#8217;t be receiving any stock, because Sweden isn&#8217;t one of the iPhone 5&#8242;s launch countries.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reader and interior design blogger Sophie Ankréus was kind enough to send us some shots of what the inside of the new store will look like, which you can check out in the gallery below. Spoiler alert: It looks like an Apple Store. But actually, there are some interesting differences, such as Sweden-exclusive products locally sourced and designed, including iPhone cases from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bjornborg.com/">Björn Borg</a> and bags from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.papsweden.se/">P.A.P</a>.</p>
