The service brings all of your social networks together into one categorized, easy-to-use interface. </p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/26/vizify-launch/">Vizify</a> brings in LinkedIn, foursquare, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram to create a complete overview of who you are. The company also recently released customizable profiles (which means users can choose a color scheme as opposed to Vizify&#8217;s default orange and black), and real-time analytics for traffic to your Vizify profile.</p>
<p>In a world where we have more than enough social networks and profiles, it seems odd that Vizify would throw their hat in the ring this way. But I think the idea is maintaining a positive &#8220;resume&#8221; of your digital self, as opposed to the services that do it for you without any permission, like Peekyou.com. Vizify shouldn&#8217;t be thought of as a competing social network, but rather a home base for who you are. The link you&#8217;d put on a business card, for example. </p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what co-founder Todd Silverstein had to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve been a data visualization nerd so we started doing visualizing our own data to see if we could do better. When we shared those pictures with some of the web-saavy folks in our network, they began demanding that we make pictures of their data too. So that&#8217;s when we realized we had stumbled onto something special. And led us to launch Vizify with the mission of helping you look your best online.</p></blockquote>
<p>Users can go through and edit things, and actually have to in some cases, to make sure the profile makes sense. </p>
<p>Vizify has raised a total of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/03/vizify-raises-1-2-million-to-help-you-make-a-great-first-impression-online/">$1.64 million</a> since launch trying to tie up the loose ends in the disconnects of your online identity.</p>
