Now, however, the design of the clocks in the app has become somewhat of a controversy as Swiss Federal Railways (mostly known under its German acronym SBB), has accused the company of ripping off the design of its iconic railway station clock design. Apple&#8217;s design is almost an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=swiss+railways+clock&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;prmd=imvnsa&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;ei=QGZbUN20HuP1igL8tIDQCw&amp;ved=0CDEQsAQ&amp;biw=1377&amp;bih=779">exact copy</a> of the Swiss Railway Station Clock that the organization has been using since the 1940s.</p>
<p>Unlike the iPhone app, the iPad app uses the Swiss Railways design in its world clock and as a spokesperson <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/digital/mobil/Apple-kopiert-die-beruehmte-SBBUhr/story/26209939">told the Swiss newspaper Tages Anzeiger</a>, &#8220;we are happy that Apple uses the Swiss Railway Station Clock. It&#8217;s evidence for the fact that this is indeed a great piece of design.&#8221;</p>

According to the newspaper report, SBB is mostly looking to collect fees for Apple&#8217;s use of its design.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not unusual for SBB to license the design of its clock and they are also widely available for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.momastore.org/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay_-Large-Swiss-Railway-Clock_10451_10001_54429_-1_26663_11551">purchase online</a>. According to Mobatime, which produces the actual clocks, it&#8217;s rather unusual for a company to just copy this classic design without permission.</p>
