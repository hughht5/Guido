For one thing, after two months where Android seemed to be gaining on iOS in mobile ad impressions, iOS saw an increase of 5 percentage points.</p>
<p>Actually, the iPhone 5 also played a big role in <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/14/velti-august-report-iphone-5/">Velti&#8217;s last report</a> — even though the device wasn&#8217;t available yet, the company was making predictions based on previous Apple launches. And indeed, the company says iOS saw a similar increase after the launch of the iPhone 4S. Apple&#8217;s mobile operating system now claims 62 percent of total impressions, while Android has 38 percent.</p>
<p>Of all the ad impressions from the iPhone 5, 43 percent came from the United States, 14 percent came from Japan, and 8 percent came from the United Kingdom. As for what people were doing with their brand-new  iPhones, Velti says 27 percent of usage in the first weekend came from social networking apps, and 22 percent came from games. Photo apps, meanwhile, declined to a low of 8 percent. One explanation: The improved camera functionality and panorama feature, which the report says &#8220;could be holding users off from using third party apps to enhance photos.&#8221;</p>

<p>The report also says that iOS 6 saw rapid gains, with 40 percent of users upgrading in the first week. Virtually all of those upgrades came from users with iOS 5, while there&#8217;s still a small group (11 percent) of iPhone owners who are holding out and sticking with iOS 4. (<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/05/after-early-boom-new-numbers-suggest-ios-6-adoption-may-be-reaching-a-plateau/">A recent report from Chartboost</a> suggests that after the early growth, iOS 6 adoption may have plateaued.)</p>
<p>In addition to reporting on the new device and operating system, Velti also says that eCPMS (the price paid by advertisers per thousand impressions) rose 15 percent overall.</p>
<p>The report is based on data from Velti&#8217;s Mobclix ad exchange, which serves ads to more than 33,500 apps. To draw the above conclusions about app usage Velti combined the usual ad impression data with third-party research.</p>
