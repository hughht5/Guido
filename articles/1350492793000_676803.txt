<p>This addition is now a part of the startup&#8217;s shopping companion bar, called the Personal Bar, which <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/25/stealthy-online-shopping-startup-commerce-sciences-launches-a-meebo-bar-for-e-commerce/">first launched into public beta this July</a>. At the time, we likened the product to a &#8220;Meebo Bar for E-Commerce,&#8221; since, like Meebo&#8217;s toolbar, Commerce Sciences&#8217; bar also places various buttons and add-ons on a toolbar that appears at the bottom of a website&#8217;s pages. However, where Meebo focuses on social media and ad integrations, the Commerce Sciences bar puts retailer-specific functions like site search, chat and feedback, a checkout button, coupons and more, on its toolbar.</p>
<p>While previously, the bar itself could be customized to the retailer&#8217;s own preferences, today&#8217;s launch of one-click personalization allows the e-commerce site to actually customize the Personal Bar to each and every individual site visitor. That means, for example, a new visitor could be shown a different version of the toolbar than a repeat customer would see &#8211; and perhaps they could be shown an introductory offer for their first purchase with the business. A hesitating shopper may be offered an instant discount or free shipping in order to encourage them to purchase.</p>

<p>Commerce Sciences founder and CEO Aviv Revach says the personalization feature has been in the works for months now, and is made possible by the startup&#8217;s proprietary big-data technology which takes into account 40 different behavioral data points. &#8220;The Personal Bar identifies the Shopper DNA anonymously,&#8221; he explains, &#8220;by analyzing where the shopper came from, products he likes, the type of shopper he is (deal-seeking shopper, loyal shopper, impatient shopper, etc.) and matches the right experience (coupon, personal message, chat support, etc.).&#8221;</p>
<p>To set up the Personal Bar on their own website, the retailer first customizes the bar using the online self-serve portal, then adds a line of JavaScript to their site. The bar is also supported on various e-commerce platforms, like Magento, osCommerce, Zen-cart, X-Cart, Demandware, and others.</p>
<p>To date, the company says it has analyzed over 22 million behavioral actions for over 8 million shoppers. In most retailers, over 12% of searches and checkouts were started via the bar, Revach tells us. Early studies also show a 24% increase in product searches and up to 3 times more Facebook Likes, he adds.</p>
<p>Since the bar&#8217;s debut this summer, over 70 customers, largely U.S.-based, have signed up, including Glassesmarket.com, theCHIVERY.com, weeDECOR, BuyEyeGlasses.com, Koffler Sales, and DUCKCO.</p>
