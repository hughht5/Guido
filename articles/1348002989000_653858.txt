This was first reported by the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/blog/atlantech/2012/09/san-francisco-mobile-payments-startup.html?ana=twt&amp;page=all">Atlanta Business Chronicle</a> earlier this month, but we&#8217;ve learned what Square is up to in Atlanta.</p>
<p>It seems like the company is upping its game when it comes to infrastructure, because most of the Atlanta office is full of engineers with that focus. Additionally, <a target="_blank" href="http://corner.squareup.com/2012/07/atlanta.html">Square says</a> that the following skills are currently housed in Atlanta as well:</p>
<blockquote><p>Their experience with various developer tools – like Google Web Toolkit, Google App Engine, Collide, and Dart – will be valuable in improving our products, services, and infrastructure as we continue to grow.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s the team based in Atlanta:</p>

<p>Square will be able to find a wealth of talent in the area, as it is close-by to Georgia Tech. I&#8217;m also told that Android developers are increasingly hard to find, since apps must be made pixel perfect for each major handset and versions of the Android OS. It&#8217;s no small task, but Square is preparing itself by opening the office and making a push to hire the best Android developers available, San Francisco based or otherwise.</p>
<p>By simply visiting <a target="_blank" href="https://squareup.com/jobs/oLYtVfwR">Square&#8217;s job page</a>, you can find all sorts of available positions for the platform:</p>

<p>Expanding to Atlanta shows what most of us already thought, that Square is a company with a massive footprint. As more offices pop up over time in the both the US, and perhaps one day internationally, Dorsey&#8217;s vision will start to spread to all corners of the planet.</p>
