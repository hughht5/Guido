This experiment, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.movikantirevo.com/">Movi.Kanti.Revo</a>, is <a target="_blank" href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/09/moving-singing-and-dreaming-with-chrome.html">now available online</a> and it&#8217;s quite a trip. The experience makes full use of HTML5 and other modern web technologies and uses your webcam (or accelerometer) to track your movements as you wander through the imaginary world.</p>
<p>Here is Google&#8217;s explanation of the experience:</p>
<blockquote><p>Movi.Kanti.Revo comes from the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto">Esperanto</a> words for moving, singing and dreaming. In the experiment, you can follow a mysterious character through a beautiful and surreal world to encounter enchanting <em>Cirque du Soleil</em> performances and live an emotional journey made of love, doubts, hopes and dreams.</p></blockquote>

If you are interested in the technical details, Google also just posted a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/casestudies/movikantirevo/">case study</a> that delves into how exactly Google, Cirque du Soleil and the development show <a target="_blank" href="http://www.yitalent.com/">Subatomic Systems</a> created this experience.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Movi.Kanti.Revo works best in Chrome. It should also work fine in other browsers, though chances are you will have to use your mouse and not your webcam to navigate.</p>
