The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/11/us-sprint-softbank-idUSBRE89A0I520121011">news leaked</a> earlier today that Softbank may be making a $12.8 billion investment in Sprint, which &#8220;could involve a change of control of Sprint,&#8221; according to the official statement.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the <a target="_blank" href="http://newsroom.sprint.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=2414">official word</a> from Sprint:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sprint (NYSE: S) today confirmed that it is currently engaged in discussions with Softbank regarding a potential substantial investment by Softbank in Sprint. Although there can be no assurances that these discussions will result in any transaction or on what terms any transaction may occur, such a transaction could involve a change of control of Sprint. Sprint does not intend to comment further unless and until an agreement is reached.</p></blockquote>
<p>Reuters sources claim that Softbank is talking to various banks to finance a bid. Clearly, Sprint has declined to comment on any specific number, but if that $12.8 billion figure holds true, Softbank would be taking over two-thirds of the company.</p>
