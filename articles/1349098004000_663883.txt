<p>The Just For Kids UI was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/16/netflix-now-for-kids/">first debuted</a> back in August of 2011, and has since made its way to the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/08/netflix-just-for-kids-xbox-360/">Xbox</a> and various Bluray players and smart TVs. </p>
<p>But children tend to really enjoy the iPad&#8217;s touch interface, but without any parental controls within the app, you never know when your ten-year-old could go from Phineas &amp; Ferb cartoons to Family Guy. </p>
<p>In other words, it only makes sense for Netflix to choose the iPad as the first device to get the mobile version of this Kid-friendly UI. </p>
<p>In Just For Kids, kids not only get to choose from various themes, but they also have a carousel at the top of the UI packed full of great characters. When you tap on a character, you&#8217;re then given all the episodes in which that character appears. </p>
<p>Netflix Just For Kids is only currently available to owners of the iPad 2 and new iPad, and the company says versions for the original iPad and Android-flavored slates will come later. </p>
