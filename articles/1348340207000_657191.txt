<p>You&#8217;d think that doing an <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/18/iphone-5-review/">iPhone 5</a> Fly Or Die would be a piece of cake, what with <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/17/apple-announces-record-pre-orders-for-iphone-5-2m-in-24-hours/">2 million pre-orders in 24 hours</a>, but it&#8217;s not so simple. All the complaining of boredom and slight lack of innovation out of Apple&#8230; well, it&#8217;s not too far off of the truth. </p>
<p>Apple took a huge risk with the original iPhone, and even with the iPod. But it turns out that those products changed their respective industries. And the iPhone, in particular, is the company&#8217;s most profitable product ever, usurping the iPod. Now, Apple is the most valuable publicly traded company in the world, and while they&#8217;ll take smaller risks with products like the iPad, there&#8217;s no reason to make a major change to their shining star. </p>
<p>For this reason, many see the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/21/watch-it-live-apple-opens-doors-to-its-nyc-flagship-store-for-iphone-5-launch/">iPhone 5</a> as a very slight upgrade to the iPhone 4S. The design isn&#8217;t all that different, though the screen is a bit larger, and even iOS 6 isn&#8217;t all that revolutionary. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/20/apple-ios-6-maps-is-a-first-attempt-were-just-getting-started/">Especially Maps</a>, but don&#8217;t get me started on that. </p>
<p>But in the end, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/22/check-out-highlights-from-our-live-coverage-of-the-iphone-5-launch-tctv/">Matt and I</a> still felt compelled to give the new iPhone a fly. It&#8217;s not necessarily about the product itself, though I maintain that it&#8217;s still one of, if not <em>the</em>, best phone on the market. Our flies have more to do with Apple&#8217;s ecosystem. Owning a MacBook, iPad, iPhone (and iPod Touch, if you&#8217;re really serious) makes life much easier than owning a Galaxy S III, a Samsung Z series laptop, and a Nexus 7 tablet. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s about the ecosystem, and the iPhone 5 is now the flagship of that ecosystem. </p>
