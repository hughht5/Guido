With this update, which should reach the stable release channel within the next few weeks, Opera&#8217;s desktop browser now supports Google&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.chromium.org/spdy">SPDY protocol</a>, Apple&#8217;s Retina displays and numerous new web standards like the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-fullscreen-20120703/">Fullscreen API</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-page-visibility-20110602/">Page Visibility API</a>. Opera 12.10 will also feature improved support for the increasingly popular <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket">WebSocket API</a>. With this release, Opera is also adding basic touch support for Windows 8 and OS X Mountain Lion users can now make use of their operating system&#8217;s built-in share feature right from Opera&#8217;s address bar and see Opera notifications in Mountain Lion&#8217;s Notifications Center.</p>
<p>The focus of this release is clearly on web standards and other developer-centric features. Opera will now, for example, provide developers with access to its Context Menu API so extensions can easily manipulate Opera&#8217;s right-click menu. This release also marks the launch of Opera&#8217;s Screenshot API, which, as the name implies, makes it easier for extension developers to add screenshot features.</p>

<p>Besides the developer features, SPDY support is probably the most important update here. Now that sites like Twitter, Gmail, and WordPress and others support SPDY, it was only a matter of time before Opera, too, would support this protocol.</p>
<p>While Opera remains one of the most popular browsers on mobile, its market share on the desktop is <a target="_blank" href="http://gs.statcounter.com/">close to negligible</a>, and while it used to be one of the fastest browsers on the market, it&#8217;s currently <a target="_blank" href="http://lifehacker.com/5948212/browser-speed-tests-mac-edition-chrome-22-firefox-15-safari-6-and-opera-1202">in danger of falling behind</a>.</p>
