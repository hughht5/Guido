And new iPods. And the fact that they&#8217;re <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/apple-is-number-1-in-u-s-notebook-sales/">number 1</a> in U.S. notebook sales. Oh, and that they&#8217;ve sold over <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/apple-has-sold-over-400-million-ios-devices-9-5-growth-since-march/">400 million iOS devices</a> in total. And one more thing, the App Store now has over <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/ios-app-store-boasts-700k-apps-90-downloaded-every-month/">700,000 apps</a>.</p>
<p>But of course, the iPhone has taken the cake. And what better way to celebrate its arrival then watching a video introducing the device featuring Jony Ive. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a jam-packed announcement to say the least. And in proper Apple fashion, the company didn&#8217;t feel the need to stream the announcement live to all their faithful fanbois. But, the video of the announcement is soon to be available, and we&#8217;ll link to it as soon as it&#8217;s up on the site. </p>
<p>In the mean time, take a look at Apple&#8217;s brand new iPhone video featuring Jony Ive and robots that build iPhones. </p>
