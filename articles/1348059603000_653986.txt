<p>Startup Health first announced <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/27/startup-health-launches-first-class-of-healthcare-transformers-tctv/">Round One of its startup academy roster in March</a>. There were ten different companies, ranging from a device that made it possible to conduct high-risk pregnancy at home to an online service that keeps all your family&#8217;s medical records in one place. Today, the incubator has added 12 more startups to the list, bringing the total to 22.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/21/startup-health-co-founders-want-to-transform-the-medical-industry/">StartUp Health is different</a> from many incubators in that companies enrolled in the program stay there for three years, taking the startup from the idea phase all the way to maturation. The program also includes various workshops and courses (in person) to make sure that each company has exactly what it needs to be successful.</p>
<p>Considering that the healthcare industry is highly regulated and slow to adapt, it only makes sense that an incubator fostering innovation in the sector would give more time, and more guidance, than the average consumer-facing accelerator.</p>
