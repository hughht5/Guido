The HTC DLX, as the report claims it&#8217;s called, appears to share both design and specification cues with the J Butterfly, and would be Verizon&#8217;s first One-series smartphone.</p>
<p>Specs according to Android Central include the 1080p 5-inch display, as well as either an 8MP or 12MP rear shooter, as well as a quad-core processor (possibly the Qualcomm Snapdrago S4 Pro at 1.5GHz according to an earlier leak by xda-developers forum member <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/Football4PDA/status/255310816113467392">Football</a>) and 2GB of RAM, plus 16GB of internal storage and a 2,500 mAh non-removable battery. Android 4.1.1 with Sense 4+ will be on-board in terms of software, according to the leak, and it&#8217;s also an LTE capable device. The report also says we should see this launching with Verizon sometime around Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>HTC reported earlier that the J Butterfly&#8217;s display would make its way out to other markets, and we&#8217;ve previously heard that such a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/17/htc-one-x-5-rumor/">device was on its way and possibly headed to Verizon</a>, so there&#8217;s good reason to believe this is real. Also, the specs are in line with that Japan-only smartphone, so it could essentially be a reworked design of that device aimed at the North American market. And if, like me, you&#8217;ve been very impressed by HTC&#8217;s recent offerings, there&#8217;s good reason to get excited about such a possibility, too. But not too excited, now that we&#8217;re living in the days of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/19/dissecting-the-sony-nexus-x-the-fake-that-launched-a-thousand-stories/">elaborate 3D renders that can do a damn good job of fooling the naked eye</a>.</p>
