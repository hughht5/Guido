It should surprise no one that it looks an awful lot like Rovio put Angry Birds characters in Star Wars costumes and setting, while retaining essentially the same gameplay. Which isn&#8217;t to say it doesn&#8217;t look good.</p>
<p>The birds have special Star Wars-themed powers and abilities, which should add an interesting twist to the already satisfying Angry Birds physics-based gameplay. The short video includes shots of Luke wielding a lightsaber, and Leia using some kind of weird tractor-beam type thing that I don&#8217;t remember coming from Star Wars canon material. This micro-trailer will be followed November 5 by a full trailer, and we&#8217;ll see the game actually released for all to play on November 8.</p>
