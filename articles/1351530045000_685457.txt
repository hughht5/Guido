Innovation Works and ff Venture&nbsp;Capital&nbsp;also participated in this round. Rincon Venture Partners was also the lead investor in The Resumator&#8217;s $700,000 Series A round in 2011. The company, which was founded in 2009, also previously received seed funding through its&nbsp;participation&nbsp;in Pittburgh&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.alphalab.org/">Alpha Labs</a>&nbsp;accelerator and from Innovation Works.</p>
<p>The company plans to use the new funding to expand its leadership team, increase customer acquisition and to secure strategic partnership. Specifically, The Resumator is looking for talent in sales, business development and operations. As for the strategic partnerships the company is&nbsp;pursuing, a company spokesperson told us that the startup is &#8220;looking to partner/integrate with HR service providers that are further up the HR technology adoption chain.&#8221; In addition, The Resumator is working with venture capital firms and accelerator programs to attract more high-growth&nbsp;potential businesses.</p>
<p>The Resumator uses social media features and more traditional recruiting tools to make it easier for companies to find, sort and review applicants. The service also includes tools to administer skill tests and a number of social features that help teams make hiring decisions together.</p>
<p>The company tells us that it is currently growing very quickly. Both 2012 U.S. presidential campaigns, as well as startups like Pinterest, Klout, MailChip, Instagram and Tumblr used it for their recruitment efforts in the last few months. In its announcement today, the company especially notes the participation of Salesforce.com, which it says should be seen as &#8220;validation that in the crowded&nbsp;recruiting software market, The Resumator stands as one of the most innovative recruiting solutions for progressive, fast growing businesses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sean Ammirati, a partner at Burchmere Ventures and the former COO of tech blog ReadWriteWeb, says that he was&nbsp;&#8221;impressed how&nbsp;The Resumator has fast become the leading hiring platform for small to medium-sized businesses in&nbsp;just three years.&#8221;</p>
