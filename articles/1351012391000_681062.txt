The store now hosts 700,000 applications, with 275,000 designed specifically for iPad. That latter number refers not just the apps that &#8220;work&#8221; on the iPad (they all do), but those which offer an iPad native version that takes advantage of the device&#8217;s larger screen.</p>
<p>For comparison purposes, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/ios-app-store-boasts-700k-apps-90-downloaded-every-month/">at Apple&#8217;s iPhone 5 event in September</a>, the company said there were 700,000 apps, with 250,000 designed for iPad, an increase of 10,000 from June. Now it&#8217;s saying that 25,000 iPad apps have been added in barely a month? I guess developers were itching for a bump from iPad Mini.</p>
<p>90% of the App Store&#8217;s apps are downloaded every month, Apple noted at the time, and customers used more than 100 on average.</p>
<p>200 million devices run iOS 6, and there are 160 million Game Center accounts now, which indicates the popularity of gaming on the iOS platform.</p>
