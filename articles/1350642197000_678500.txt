<p>Notorious smut peddler, &#8220;Violentacrez&#8221;, gave his first Interview with CNN&#8217;s Anderson Cooper last night. <a target="_blank" href="http://gawker.com/5950981/unmasking-reddits-violentacrez-the-biggest-troll-on-the-web">After being </a>outed by Gawker last week, the 49-year-old softspoken software engineer has lost his job and rekindled a fierce debate over the limits of free speech. &#8220;I am to some degree apologizing for what I did,&#8221; said Michael Brutsch, &#8220;Violentacrez is what I did in my spare time to unwind from my 10-hour-a-day job. That’s how I relaxed in the evening. I no longer need to relax in the evening, because I no longer have a job.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brutsch came to notoriety by posting racist and misogynistic photos to the popular content aggregator, Reddit, including one forum of underage girls, dubbed &#8220;jailbait&#8221;. He was the creator and main contributor to some of Reddit&#8217;s most disgusting subreddits including, but definitely not limited to: /r/chokeabitch, /r/rapebait, /r/hitler, /r/jewmeric, and /r/incest.</p>
<p>Despite the outcry against trolls like Brutsch, Reddit defends the strict free speech policies of the user-generated portions of the site (&#8220;subreddits&#8221;). &#8220;We stand for free speech … We are not going to ban distasteful subreddits,&#8221; <a target="_blank" href="http://mashable.com/2012/10/17/reddit-ceo-ban-distasteful-content/">said</a> CEO Yishan Wong.</p>
