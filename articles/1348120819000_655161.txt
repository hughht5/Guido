In fact, after a lackluster Q1, corporate VCs are opening up their wallets as deal activity hits a five quarter high. CB Insights says the average corporate deal size rose in the quarter to $17.8 million.</p>
<p>As The New York Times <a target="_blank" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/09/03/multinationals-stake-a-claim-in-venture-capital/">reported recently</a>, corporate VCs are doubling down of late, taking stakes in many of the tech sector&#8217;s most promising ideas and innovations. </p>

<p>According the report (which measured deals made from corporations which have a dedicated venture arm), corporate VCs (CVs) are doing more deals, participating in larger average rounds and doing more at the early, speculative seed stage. Overall, CVCs participated in 15% of all venture deals that occurred in Q2 2012 (up from 11% in Q1 2012).</p>
<p>Specifically, internet deals and funding from CVCs increased for the third straight quarter. Corporate VC investment in internet companies rose to a five-quarter high in terms of  both deals and dollars. Deals and dollars rose 60% and 15%, respectively, vs. Q1 2012.</p>
<p>CVC funding to the mobile sector hit a five quarter high and within mobile fundings, video, collaboration &amp; communication technologies saw the most attention from CVCs.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/?attachment_id=655427" rel="attachment wp-att-655427"></a></p>
<p>In Q2, deals in which CVCs participated were $7.8 million  greater than the overall VC deal average coming in at $17.8  million.  While overall VC average deal size has stayed flat at $10 million over the last 5 quarters, deals in which CVCs participate have gotten bigger. Additionally, 84% of deals had<br />
additional investors.  This, however, is a dip from Q1 where 90% of deals had syndicate partners. And 6% of deals had 10 ore more co-investors (a.k.a. party rounds). </p>
