The paper is <a target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390443635404578033684191275730.html">reporting</a> that Asian suppliers to Apple have kicked off mass production of components required to make a smaller version of the iPad. The paper cites &#8220;people with knowledge of the situation&#8221;.</p>
<p>South Korea&#8217;s LG Display company and Taiwan&#8217;s AU Optronics started mass production of the LCD screens for the new device last month, according to the paper&#8217;s sources.</p>
<p>Apple does not comment on rumour and speculation but we&#8217;ve reached out all the same.</p>
<p>The paper&#8217;s sources say the smaller iPad tablet will have a 7.85-inch liquid-crystal display with a lower resolution than the latest iPad model &#8212; the third generation iPad &#8212; which would means no Retina Display on the iPad Mini.</p>
<p>Price will be a key consideration for any smaller iPad so a lower resolution is one area where Apple could cut costs to ensure the Mini carries a suitably diminutive price-tag.</p>
<p>iPad Mini leaks have been circulating for months &#8212; with photos apparently indicating the smaller iPad will have <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/02/leaked-ipad-mini-pics-show-nano-sim-card-slot-anodized-aluminum-casing/">a nano SIM slot</a> and an anodized aluminum casing. Other leaks have indicated Apple plans to shrink the size of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/18/alleged-leaked-ipad-mini-pics-show-lightening-port-odd-hole-on-the-back/">the bezels</a> on the iPad Mini to maximise screen real estate, and also depicted a strange hole in the top center of the tablet’s backside. Also expected: the Mini will rock <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/apples-new-lightning-connector-what-it-does-and-doesnt-change/">Apple&#8217;s new Lightning port</a>.</p>
<p>An Apple investor also <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/01/report-ipad-mini-press-event-invitations-going-out-october-10/">recently reported</a> invitations for a press event to launch the iPad Mini would be sent out on October 10.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s former CEO Steve Jobs famously slated the small tablet form factor back in 2010 &#8212; claiming it would <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/18/steve-jobs-no-small-ipad/">need to come with sandpaper</a> so people could file down their fingers to use it. Since then a raft of 7+ inch tablets have launched &#8212; including Google&#8217;s cheap-as-chips <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/02/google-nexus-7-review/">Nexus 7 slate</a>, and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/06/say-hello-to-amazons-new-kindle-fire-family-bigger-fire-hds-159-upgraded-original/">Amazon&#8217;s Kindle Fire</a> tablets (which now come in small and large sizes) &#8212; suggesting there is a market in a mid-sized device that&#8217;s smaller than a full-sized iPad but larger than a smartphone.</p>
<p>More to come&#8230;</p>
