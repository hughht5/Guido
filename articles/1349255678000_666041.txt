The paper is <a target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390443635404578033684191275730.html">reporting</a> that Asian suppliers to Apple have kicked off mass production of components required to make a smaller version of the iPad. The paper cites &#8220;people with knowledge of the situation&#8221;.</p>
<p>South Korea&#8217;s LG Display company and Taiwan&#8217;s AU Optronics started mass production of the LCD screens for the new device last month, according to the paper&#8217;s sources.</p>
<p>Apple does not comment on rumour and speculation but we&#8217;ve reached out all the same.</p>
<p>The paper&#8217;s sources say the smaller iPad tablet will have a 7.85-inch liquid-crystal display with a lower resolution than the latest iPad model &#8212; the third generation iPad &#8212; which would means no Retina Display on the iPad Mini.</p>
<p>Price will be a key consideration for any smaller iPad so a lower resolution is one area where Apple could cut costs to ensure the Mini carries a suitably diminutive price-tag.</p>
<p>More to come&#8230;</p>
