Despite joining Twitter in January 2010 his verified account had never tweeted anything &#8212; until a few moments ago, when he said this:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>I&#8217;m starting Conference with this new Twitter feed about my role as Conservative Leader. I promise there won&#8217;t be &#8220;too many tweets&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>— David Cameron (@David_Cameron) <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/David_Cameron/status/254625004321386496">October 6, 2012</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The &#8220;too many tweets&#8230;&#8221; comment is a reference to a radio interview in 2009 in which Cameron was asked for his views on Twitter, and whether he might start tweeting, and he replied: &#8221;The trouble with Twitter, the instantness of it – too many twits might make a twat.&#8221; (The Guardian has a video clip of the moment <a target="_blank" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/video/2009/jul/29/david-cameron-twitter">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Use of the word &#8220;twat&#8221; on a live breakfast radio show got Cameron into a spot of instant hot water &#8212; and he subsequently apologised for his choice of words.</p>
<p>The PM&#8217;s office tweets coalition government-related policy pronouncements and updates from the @Number10gov account. But of course Cameron can&#8217;t use an official government channel to discuss Conservative Party-specific issues &#8212; hence his need to kick-start <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/David_Cameron">@David_Cameron</a>.</p>
<p>Why Cameron feels the need to open up a personal communication channel now &#8212; with the specific aim of discussing his role as leader &#8212; can be explained by growing rumblings of discontent in the Conservative party about the direction of his leadership.</p>
<p>A <a target="_blank" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/oct/06/david-cameron-challenge-tories?newsfeed=true">report</a> in today&#8217;s Guardian notes that two of Cameron&#8217;s most senior cabinet colleagues are backing a group calling for a major overhaul of his leadership strategy.</p>
<p>Conservative party traditionalists have been angered by his attempts to modernise party policy &#8211; which makes it all the more apt Cameron has taken to Twitter &#8212; the epitome of a modern digital communications medium &#8212; to try to silence his critics. This is &#8216;put up or shut up&#8217; 21st century style.</p>
