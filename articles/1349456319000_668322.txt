Days after the announcement that the firm had <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/03/andreessen-horowitz-iinvests-15-million-in-rap-genius/">invested $15 million</a> in innovative hip hop annotations startup Rap Genius, we learn that it&#8217;s hired <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/elizabeth/status/254243978298421248">Elizabeth Weil</a> away from Twitter.</p>
<p>Weil was a marketing executive at Twitter, and prior to that worked at another VC firm, Institutional Venture Partners, where she focused on investments in Internet and digital media. Before IVP, Weil was an investment analyst at Menlo Ventures.</p>
<p>In addition to working 80-hour weeks for Twitter, Weil also <a target="_blank" href="runs the digitally focused Paperwheel Press">runs the digitally focused Paperwheel Press</a> out of her garage: Handmaking &#8220;Welcome&#8217;&#8221;notes to new Twitter employees among other things. She and her husband, Twitter director of revenue products Kevin Weil, are also accomplished marathon runners.</p>
<p>Weil apparently wore a few hats during her three years at Twitter (her Twitter bio lists &#8220;Design and Culture&#8221; and she also had a stint in Corporate Development) and we as of yet have no word on what exact projects she&#8217;ll be working on at Andreessen.</p>
<p>Weil did <a target="_blank" href="http://allthingsd.com/20121005/andreessen-horowitz-hires-twitters-elizabeth-weil-to-focus-on-social/">confirm</a> to AllThingsD that she will be Partner at the firm, in charge of &#8220;social&#8221; investments and working with A16z Market Development Partner Mark Cranny. The breakthrough VC also recently scored with another startuppy hire: Foursquare dynamo <a target="_blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/tristanwalker">Tristan Walker</a> as EIR.</p>
