<p>Weil was a Marketing Executive at Twitter and prior to that worked at another VC firm, Institutional Venture Partners. In addition to working 80 hour weeks for Twitter, Weil also <a target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903461304576527061695101804.html">runs the digitally focused Paperwheel Pres</a>s out of her garage: Handmaking &#8216;Welcome&#8217; notes to new Twitter employees among other things. </p>
