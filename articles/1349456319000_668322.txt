Days after the announcement that it had invested $15m in innovative hip hop annotations startup Rap Genius, we learn that it&#8217;s hired <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/elizabeth/status/254243978298421248">Elizabeth Weil</a> away from Twitter. </p>
<p>Weil was a Marketing Executive at Twitter and prior to that worked at another VC firm, Institutional Venture Partners. In addition to working 80 hour weeks for Twitter, Weil also <a target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903461304576527061695101804.html">runs the digitally focused Paperwheel Pres</a>s out of her garage: Handmaking &#8216;Welcome&#8217; notes to new Twitter employees among other things. She and her husband are also accomplished marathon runners.</p>
<p>Weil apparently wore a few hats at Twitter (her Twitter bio lists &#8220;Design and Culture&#8221;) and we as of yet have no word on what she&#8217;ll be doing at Andreessen. The breakthrough VC also recently scored with another startuppy hire: Foursquare dynamo Tristan Walker as EIR. </p>
