<p>Twitter has announced a new email newsletter initiative, hoping that you&#8217;ll find people that you might already know on the service and then come back to interact.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what Twitter had to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>This weekly email highlights a handful of people you may know who use Twitter. You can choose to follow any of the suggested people and you can find more people you may know on twitter.com. Suggestions are based on signals like who your friends follow and the contact information imported by people you know. For example, if several people you know follow someone, you may also know them and want to follow them too. There’s no telling who you might find on Twitter, so open this weekly message for an ongoing source of great accounts to follow.</p></blockquote>
