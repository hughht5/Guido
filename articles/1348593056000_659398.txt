<p>Damn: Alec Saunders, VP Developer Relations &amp; Ecosystem for RIM, has got some pipes. This little ditty, sung to the tune of <em>Keep On Loving You</em> by REO Speedwagon, is RIM&#8217;s way of saying that they still love the developers who have dedicated their lives, businesses, and livelihood to the platform. That, my friends, is a nice, honest sentiment.</p>
<p>Arguably, they need this Neal Doughty bump. The BB10 platform is still as vaporous as Chris Smith&#8217;s ethereal guitar and the platform is as slow to market as &#8216;Wagon tribute bands are quick to sell out State Fairs. While I&#8217;d love to say something like &#8220;Ha! Look how desperate RIM is here!&#8221; I won&#8217;t. Why? Because these are real devs trying to do their job. Whether they&#8217;re coding away in a company in transition or, as I believe, a burning building, is not my call.</p>
<p>So sing out, Martyn Mallick, VP Global Alliances and Business, and clang your git-fiddle, Chris Smith. BlackBerry clearly means a lot to you. Sadly, it&#8217;s beginning to not matter much to your customers. It&#8217;s your job to make sure that they can&#8217;t fight this feeling anymore because the company seems lost in a dream. Don&#8217;t be only a summer love, RIM. Keep pushin&#8217;, if only for Little Queenie.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll always be my sophisticated lady.</p>
