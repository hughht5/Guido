The Korean electronic giant just sent out invites for an October 24th NYC event. And judging by the prominent S-Pen graphic, the Samsung Galaxy Note II is likely the topic. </p>
<p>Giant phone lovers, rejoice. Samsung&#8217;s latest is about to hit the states.</p>
<p>The Next Big Thing Is Here, says the invite. And while that&#8217;s sort of confusing, since, you know, the Galaxy Note II is actually not here yet. It soon will be. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/19/samsungs-galaxy-note-ii-will-launch-on-all-five-major-u-s-wireless-carriers-by-mid-november/">Per an earlier report</a>, the phablet is scheduled launch on the top five US wireless carriers by mid-November. That&#8217;s just weeks after this press event, likely signalling the Galaxy Note II should be available for preorder as soon as its announced for the US market.</p>
<p>The 5.5-inch phone/tablet is expected to cost between $249 and $299 with a two-year wireless contract. It utilizes a Super AMOLED screen compatible with Samsung redesigned S-Pen. </p>
