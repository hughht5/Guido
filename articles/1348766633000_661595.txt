The Korean electronic giant just sent out invites for an October 24th NYC event. And judging by the prominent S-Pen graphic, the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/29/samsung-note-2/">Samsung Galaxy Note II</a> is likely the topic. </p>
<p>Giant phone lovers, rejoice. Samsung&#8217;s latest is about to hit the states.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf5-Prx19ZM">Next Big Thing</a> Is Here, says the invite. And while that&#8217;s sort of confusing, since, you know, the Galaxy Note II is actually <em>not</em> here yet. It soon will be. </p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/19/samsungs-galaxy-note-ii-will-launch-on-all-five-major-u-s-wireless-carriers-by-mid-november/">Per an earlier report</a>, the phablet is scheduled launch on the top five US wireless carriers by mid-November. That&#8217;s just weeks after this press event, likely signaling the Galaxy Note II should be available for preorder as soon as its announced for the US market.</p>
<p>The 5.5-inch phone/tablet is expected to cost between $249 and $299 with a two-year wireless contract. It utilizes a 5.5-inch 720p Super AMOLED screen compatible with Samsung redesigned S-Pen. And under the hood it&#8217;s looking just as impressive, with a 1.6GHz quad-core proc, 2GB of RAM, and a massive 3,100mAh battery. </p>
<p>It should be a beauty, and a big one at that. As expected, we&#8217;ll be at the event with a liveblog fired up and a camera at the ready. </p>
