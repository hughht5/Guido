The vehicles always have someone in the driver&#8217;s seat, but the purposefully low-key exterior and the spinning light detection and ranging (LiDAR) <a target="_blank" href="http://velodynelidar.com/lidar/hdlproducts/hdl64e.aspx">devices</a> on the roof make it pretty apparent that they&#8217;re a bit different than their fully human-operated counterparts. </p>
<p>And it looks like such sightings will become more and more common throughout the state of California in the months to come.</p>
<p>Today, the office of California Governor Jerry Brown <a target="_blank" href="http://gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=17752">announced</a> that he has signed into law a bill &#8220;that allows driverless cars to be operated on public roads for testing purposes, provided that each vehicle has a full licensed and bonded operator in the driver&#8217;s seat to take control if necessary.&#8221; </p>
<p><div id="attachment_659868" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/screen-shot-2012-09-25-at-4-57-03-pm.png" rel="lightbox[659848]"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">State Senator Alex Padilla, Google co-founder Sergey Brin (yes, sporting Google Glass), and California Governor Jerry Brown</p></div>The bill, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/sen/sb_1251-1300/sb_1298_bill_20120223_introduced.html">SB1298</a> authored by state Senator Alex Padilla, also requires that the California DMV will adopt regulations that specifically cover autonomous vehicles. According to a <a target="_blank" href="http://gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=17752">press release issued</a> by the Governor&#8217;s office today, Jerry Brown visited Google&#8217;s headquarters in Mountain View and took one of the company&#8217;s self-driving cars for a spin there prior to signing the bill into law. </p>
<p>The governor&#8217;s office says that this legislation &#8220;paves the way for new technology that could reduce highway fatalities, pollution and congestion while expanding mobility options for elderly and disabled people.&#8221;</p>
<p>As my colleague Greg Ferenstein <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/24/how-googles-powerful-lobby-legalized-driverless-cars-in-california/">reported yesterday</a>, Google has lobbied very hard for this bill. But the company is not alone in believing that autonomous vehicles could be key to the future. If you talk to the founding teams at startups such as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/zimride">Zimride</a> (which operates <a target="_blank" href="http://lyft.me/">Lyft</a> of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/17/lyfts-focus-on-community-and-the-story-behind-the-pink-mustache/">pink mustache fame</a>) and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/26/sidecar/">SideCar</a>, they will tell you that one of the most exciting things about the budding ride-sharing space is the possibility that the core technology there could ultimately be leveraged in a future time when computers are operating many of the vehicles out there on the roads. And right now, it looks like that future is approaching faster than many people might think.</p>
