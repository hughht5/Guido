<p>&#8220;From all of us at Apple, we say, &#8216;We&#8217;re good. We don&#8217;t need any more of your money now,&#8217;&#8221; says the fictional Apple CEO played by Christopher McDonald.</p>
<p>Apple just rolled out its latest iPhone and iPods at a big event in San Francisco. But what if they didn&#8217;t. What if they didn&#8217;t announce anything at all and just simply called press into Moscone Center for a stock bump. And then announce nothing. </p>
<p>Fanboys, this is a parody. Settle down. It&#8217;s funny.</p>
