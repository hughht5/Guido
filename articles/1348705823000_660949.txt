This comes from the latest build of the iOS benchmarking software, Geekbench, which just released its iOS 6 version today. Earlier builds clocked the iPhone 5 at 1GHz. But now that the software is compiled for iOS 6, it seems the A6 is slightly faster and both CPU cores runs at 1.3GHz.</p>
<p>As Primate Labs&#8217; John Poole states, the latest build of the app &#8220;a dramatically improved processor frequency detection algorithm, which consistently reports the A6&#8242;s frequency as 1.3GHz.&#8221;</p>
<p>Early Geekbench tests seemed suggest the A6 ran between 1GHz to 1.2GHz. But <a target="_blank" href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/26/apple-a6-cpu-13ghz-geekbench-confirmed-overclocking/">per a conversation Engadget</a>, Poole indicated Geekbench wasn&#8217;t properly measuring the clock speed before. &#8220;Earlier versions of Geekbench had trouble determining the A6&#8242;s frequency, which lead to people claiming the A6&#8242;s frequency as 1.0GHz as it was the most common value Geekbench reported,&#8221; he stated. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/6309/iphone-5a6-sunspider-performance">Tests have found</a> the iPhone 5 to be the fastest, most powerful smartphone to date. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Apple-A6-Teardown/10528/1">Teardowns revealed</a> the A6 is a custom chip with dual CPU cores and three GPUs. The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/6297/iphone-5-memory-size-and-speed-revealed-1gb-lpddr21066">A6 also have roughly</a> 33% more peak memory bandwidth than the A5 used in the iPhone 4S. However, Apple has yet to, and likely won&#8217;t, confirm or reveal many of the nitty-gritty technical details. All that&#8217;s known is the iPhone 5 is really powerful. And that&#8217;s how Apple likes to keep it.</p>
