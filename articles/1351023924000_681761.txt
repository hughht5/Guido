The company says that in Q3, it made $1.09 billion in advertising, a 36% increase from the same quarter last year and also a sequential increase compared to Q2&#8242;s $992 million in ad sales. It&#8217;s also becoming an increasingly important part of the revenue mix: it is now 86% of total revenues, compared to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/26/facebook-q2-ad-sales-of-992m-creeps-up-to-84-of-1-18b-revenue-total/">84% last quarter</a>. </p>
<p>Mobile ads, introduced network-wide this quarter, are now 14% of the mix.</p>
<p>More to come. Refresh for updates.</p>
