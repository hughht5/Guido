<p>This is the second person join Andreessen Horowitz as a special advisor: Last year, former Harvard president and U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/29/larry-summers-joins-andreessen-horowitz-as-special-advisor/">entered the venture capital world in the same role</a>.</p>
<p>In a phone interview today, Andreessen Horowitz partner Margit Wennmachers and Fenty said that the role will be a part-time position, with Fenty splitting his time between D.C. and Silicon Valley. </p>
<p>Fenty is well-known for making <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Fenty#D.C._mayor_.282007.E2.80.9311.29">major changes to the D.C. public education system</a> during his tenure as mayor, so he will be working a lot with the education technology startups in Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s portfolio, Wennmachers said: </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a disruptive thinker and he&#8217;s got a track record to prove it. We don&#8217;t shy away from controversy, and we like that this guy knows how to shake up the status quo.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Though the worlds of venture capital and electoral politics don&#8217;t always overlap, Fenty said that there are certainly parallels between the two roles. &#8220;As a mayor you have a lot of districts you work with, and every day is different,&#8221; he said, noting that the same could be said for VCs who work with different startups. However, the pace will likely be a bit quicker here than in the political realm. &#8220;I believe that change should happen fast and in big ways, and that&#8217;s the tech industry.&#8221;</p>
