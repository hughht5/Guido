The show teased &#8220;big changes&#8221; coming to Twitter, and drew it out pretty well giving a company tour.</p>
<p>The company announced that there are over 140 million users, with 340 million tweets per day, currently. Twitter also has an $8B valuation, which is just massive, not to mention a whopping 900 employees in San Francisco alone.</p>
<p>At times, this felt like a commercial for Twitter, discussing the free snacks they get.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twitter brings you closer to the action and your heroes&#8221; said Costolo.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what the company <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.twitter.com/2012/09/because-you-have-more-to-show.html">had to say on its blog</a> about the web update:</p>
<blockquote><p>Starting today you can make your presence on Twitter more meaningful with new Twitter profiles. Upload an all-new header photo on mobile apps for iPad, iPhone and Android or twitter.com, and the same image will appear whenever anyone views your profile on the web or these apps. You can upload your header photo, which appears above your Tweets, to express yourself instantly, anywhere.</p></blockquote>

<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.twitter.com/2012/09/expand-your-experience-new-twitter-for.html">iPad update</a> looks absolutely gorgeous:</p>

<p>Twitter for Android has also gotten a fairly decent update, including support for new profiles and photo streams.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve known about Twitter&#8217;s appearance on the TODAY show since yesterday, but had no idea what would be discussed or announced.</p>

<p>The company didn&#8217;t let us down, as this is a fairly grand way to announce design changes. </p>
