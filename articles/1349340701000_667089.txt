<p>&#8220;ENISA aims to support the cyber crisis community in improving the resilience of critical information infrastructures,&#8221; notes Prof. <a target="_blank" href="https://wpyadmin.ne.cision.com/l/jgpldfql/www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/executive-director">Udo Helmbrecht</a>, Executive Director of ENISA, in a statement.</p>
<p>The exercise has three main aims:</p>
<ol>
<li>Test effectiveness and scalability of existing mechanisms, procedures and information flow for public authorities’ cooperation in Europe;</li>
<li>Explore the cooperation between public and private stakeholders in Europe;</li>
<li>Identify gaps and challenges on how large scale cyber incidents could be handled more effectively in Europe.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first Cyber Europe event took place in 2010 but this event is larger and more complex &#8212; with 300 security professionals (rather than the 70+ who took part in 2010) and enough &#8220;cyber incidents&#8221; being triggered to challenge the participants (more than 1000 injects by the end of the exercise vs 300+ in the 2010 exercise). The event will also look to test the scope for cooperation between the different countries and sectors participating.</p>
<p>In ENISA&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/cyber-europe/ce2010/ce2010report">final report</a> on the 2010 cyber security exercise it recommended</p>
<ul>
<li>more cyber security exercises in the future,</li>
<li>increased collaboration between the Member States,</li>
<li>the importance of the private sector in ensuring security.</li>
</ul>
<p>The 2012 attack scenario involves combining multiple &#8220;technically realistic threats&#8221; into one simultaneously escalating Distributed Denial of Service attack on online services in all participating countries &#8212; 25 countries are actively participating, while four countries have observers attending the event.</p>
<p>The European Commission&#8217;s communication from 2009 on <a target="_blank" href="http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/nis/strategy/activities/ciip/index_en.htm">Critical Information Infrastructure Protection</a> helped established the first pan-European Cyber Exercise.</p>
