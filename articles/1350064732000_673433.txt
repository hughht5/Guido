It&#8217;s not a feature that I&#8217;ve used a lot, even though I&#8217;m a huge movie freak. I can safely say that I&#8217;ve seen at least 50 percent of the movies ever released. That&#8217;s not really scientific, but Path has released some scientific information about the most watched movies as shared by its users on the service.</p>
<p>Any guesses as to what&#8217;s #1? Ugh, it&#8217;s &#8220;The Hunger Games.&#8221; Not my kinda thing, even though I saw it, but the list shows what was watched, not the sentiment that followed. Here are the <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.path.com/post/33437067287/movies">overall top ten most watched movies</a> on Path:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. The Hunger Games<br />
2. Marvel’s The Avengers<br />
3. The Dark Knight Rises<br />
4. Looper<br />
5. Ted<br />
6. The Dictator<br />
7. The Expendables 2<br />
8. The Cabin in the Woods<br />
9. Think Like A Man<br />
10. 21 Jump Street</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s the scientific-y explanation from Path on these trends:</p>
<blockquote><p>We took a look at movie watching in all major American cities and made a few surprising discoveries. Bostonians don’t watch a lot of movies. And while comparatively few movie moments are posted by you New Englanders, in Houston, quite the opposite is true – more movies are watched per capita than even LA (a close second!).</p></blockquote>
<p>I haven&#8217;t seen all of these, sadly. I&#8217;m falling behind in my movie watching, apparently. There&#8217;s no <em>Say Anything&#8230;</em> on the list, and I&#8217;m pretty bummed about that to be honest. As far as Path goes, I still find it personally difficult to fit into my daily app usage. I love checking up on what my friends are sharing, but I haven&#8217;t been good at sharing my own stuff. Friends try to nudge me to use it, but I&#8217;m not sure what the disconnect is.</p>
<p>The app is gorgeous, the execution is spot-on, but I tend to use Twitter, Google+ and Facebook way much more. What are your experiences with Path? Share &#8216;em in the comments!</p>
