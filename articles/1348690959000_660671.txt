Nintendo stated previously that there would be 50 available before March 31, so, relatively so, the Wii U is launching with a strong amount of games including New Super Mario Bros U, Call of Duty: Black Ops II and, yes, Nintendo Land, the game Nintendo hopes will be the Wii Sports of its new console (it won&#8217;t).</p>
<p>Nintendo revealed and demoed many of these titles at its E3 2012 press conference. Nintendo Land is a strange consortium of mini games and social elements. The company stated over and over again that the title is the Wii U&#8217;s Wii Sports, but after seeing the presentation and playing some of the games on the show floor, we&#8217;re not convinced it has the same magic.</p>
<p>Many of the titles below showcase the Wii U&#8217;s novel touchscreen controller. By building in a secondary screen, the Wii U controller can act like a backpack in an RPG, gun sight in a FPS or a playbook for sports games.</p>
<p>The Wii U will <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/13/nintendos-wii-u-hits-u-s-stores-november-18-starts-at-299-99/">come in two versions</a>. The basic version will cost $299 and comes packing the Wii U controller and a console with 8GB storage. Or, buyers can opt for the $349 Deluxe Set, which includes 32GB of local storage, a Wii U controller charging cradle, Wii U console stand and a copy of Nintendo Land.</p>
