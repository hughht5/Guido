Designed to reduce the &#8220;problems&#8221; associated with biking &#8211; namely collisions and mapping &#8211; the bike/microprocessor system is fully electric and connects with your smartphone to perform some very interesting tricks.</p>
<p>First, there&#8217;s collision avoidance that offers haptic feedback when you&#8217;re about to slam into something. The bike also works with your smartphone for built-in mapping and &#8220;drive by wire&#8221; control of your brakes and transmission. The creators hope to offer ubiquitous computing built-in for &#8220;data sensing, real-time intelligent tracking systems, dynamic routing, and social integration.&#8221;</p>
<p>The founder, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jack-al-kahwati/1/42a/89b">Jack Al-Kahwati</a> is an former Sikorsky and BAE engineer, which I suspect means that soon he&#8217;ll be able to add carbon fiber wings to this thing and make it fly you over traffic.</p>
<p>I saw these guys <a target="_blank" href="http://makerfaire.com/pub/e/8836">at the NYC Maker Faire</a> and was really excited to see a svelte electric bike. Little did I know that these things were going to be far cooler than I imagined. The plan is to launch a Kickstarter in the next few months but a prototype is working now and the team is building out more features.</p>

<p>Again, it&#8217;s still early to call it, but it&#8217;s definitely an ambitious and cool hardware project.</p>
