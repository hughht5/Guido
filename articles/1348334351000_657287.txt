<p>There are very few things that will get me out of bed at 5am: a family tragedy, more than $100,000 in cash, and a new iPhone. Of course, Matt and I were there to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/21/watch-it-live-apple-opens-doors-to-its-nyc-flagship-store-for-iphone-5-launch/">cover the launch of the iPhone 5 live</a>, but we weren&#8217;t the only early risers yesterday. Thousands of people, including fanboys, brands, and members of the media (not to mention Apple geniuses), were at Apple&#8217;s Fifth Ave. flagship store in NYC at the crack of dawn. </p>
<p>Yes, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/21/in-line-for-the-iphone-5-all-of-this-for-a-phone/">all for a phone</a>. </p>
<p>It was an experience I&#8217;ll always remember, even if I wasn&#8217;t <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/21/sleep-tight-sweet-romain-youve-earned-it/">the one assigned</a> to the iPhone line for 24 hours. (Thanks again, and well done, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/21/sleep-tight-sweet-romain-youve-earned-it/">Romain</a>.) We met plenty of fun iPhone 5 owners-to-be, including Tanvee, a young woman who was waiting in line to buy her husband the new iPhone. She certainly captured the hearts and minds of our <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/crunchphone?q=crunchphone">#CrunchPhone twitter followers</a>. </p>
<p>We also had a slight run-in with Apple security (who really shouldn&#8217;t be trifled with), got ourselves some donuts, and met what could be two FBI agents (or Samsung employees &mdash; they refused to inform us of their employer). </p>
<p>All in all, it was a great morning, and we hope you enjoy this quick glance back at the magic. </p>
