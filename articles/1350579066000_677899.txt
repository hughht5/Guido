Revenues are up 45 percent compared to Q3 2011 and now represents $14.10 billion. However, GAAP net income is down 20 percent year-over-year to $2.18 billion, or $6.53 per share, compared to $2.73 billion for Q3 2011, or $8.33 per share. Non-GAAP earnings per share is at $9.03 compared to $9.72 year-over-year. Google fell short on expectations and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/18/googles-stock-takes-a-dive-after-mid-day-earnings-release-trading-halted/">stock is taking a dive today</a>.</p>
<p>Analysts were <a target="_blank" href="http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/earnings/earnings.asp?ticker=GOOG">expecting</a> $14.7 billion in revenue. Google missed by $600 million on those estimates. Analysts expected non-GAAP $10.66 EPS.</p>
<p>Even though revenue is following an impressive trend, profits are not following the same trend and are the source of today&#8217;s disappointment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ads still represent a major part of Google&#8217;s business. With $11.53 billion, 82 percent of consolidated revenues come from the different advertising offerings.</p>
<p>Among Google&#8217;s unit, Motorola is becoming a major part of the company. Google bought Motorola Mobility last year for $12.5 billion. It now accounts for <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/18/motorola-3q2012-revenues-2-58-billion-18-of-revenue-for-googles-total-q3/">18 percent of the revenue</a> compared to 10 percent last quarter.</p>
<p>Yet, Motorola is a burden as well as Motorola recorded a $527 million GAAP operating loss. The acquisition added 20,293 employees. It represented a 59 percent increase in Google&#8217;s total headcount. Google reports 53,546 full-time employees as of September 30 compared to 54,604 as of June 30. 36,118 are working for Google and 17,428 employees are in Motorola&#8217;s business unit.</p>
<p>Google-owned sites generated $7.73 billion of revenue, or 67 percent of the total revenue. That percentage is stable compared to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/19/google-beats-in-q2-2012-revenue-up-35-percent-to-12-21b-2-79b-in-net-income/">Q2 2012</a>.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s earnings call is scheduled for 1:30 PM PT today, but leaked early. There was apparently a mix-up with the 8K earnings statement. Here is Google&#8217;s statement on the matter:</p>
<blockquote><p>Earlier this morning RR Donnelley, the financial printer, informed us that they had filed our draft 8K earnings statement without authorization.  We have ceased trading on NASDAQ while we work to finalize the document.  Once it&#8217;s finalized we will release our earnings, resume trading on NASDAQ and hold our earnings call as normal at 1:30 PM PT.</p></blockquote>
<p>Details from the earnings call will follow this afternoon as executives will bring context to those numbers.</p>
