Revenues are up 45 percent compared to Q3 2011 and now represents $14.10 billion. However, GAAP net income is down 20 percent to $2.18 billion, or $8.33 a share in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP earnings per share is at $6.53. Google fell short on expectations and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/18/googles-stock-takes-a-dive-after-mid-day-earnings-release-trading-halted/">stock is taking a dive today</a>.</p>
<p>Analysts were <a target="_blank" href="http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/earnings/earnings.asp?ticker=GOOG">expecting</a> $14.7 billion in revenue. Google missed by $600 million on those estimates.</p>

<p>Among Google&#8217;s unit, Motorola is becoming a major part of the company. Google bought Motorola Mobility last year for $12.5 billion. It now accounts for <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/18/motorola-3q2012-revenues-2-58-billion-18-of-revenue-for-googles-total-q3/">18 percent of the revenue</a> compared to 10 percent last quarter.</p>
<p>Yet, Motorola is a burden as well as Motorola recorded a $527 million GAAP operating loss.</p>
