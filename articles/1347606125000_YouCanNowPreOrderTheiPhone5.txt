As a reminder, the iPhone 5 is $199 on contract for the 16GB version, the 32GB model is $299, and for those with large media libraries, the $399 version is 64GB. An unlocked version is coming to the U.S. a little later on, for $649, $749, and $849, respectively.</p>
<p>As usual, Apple provides a tool for checking upgrade eligibility with your respective carrier, and you can order a device set up with Sprint, AT&amp;T or Verizon. So go get it, but expect delays, because usually Apple&#8217;s store goes down and has all kinds of issues keeping up with demand when this type of shizz goes down.</p>
