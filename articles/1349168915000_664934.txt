<p>We knew it was potentially on the cards (see <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/27/the-stench-of-an-ipo/">background</a>) but now an IPO for the B2B Services Exchange, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.blurgroup.com/">Blur Group</a>, has become a reality: The company has today announced that it&#8217;s to begin trading on LSE AIM this Friday.</p>
<p>It will consist of a placing of 4,878,049 new ordinary shares at a price of 82 pence ($1.33) per share,  raising gross placing proceeds of $6.48 million (£4 million). This will give Blur Group a market cap of approximately $32.6 million (£20.1 million) based on the placing price for the entire issued and to be issued share capital of the company.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s some of the key points pulled from the official release (note that sales/revenue figures have been published for the first time):</p>
<blockquote><p>● blur Group owns and operates online exchanges where businesses in any country can buy, sell and pay for business services like marketing, advertising and technology. Businesses brief projects and expert service providers pitch for the project and the entire process runs online right through to project delivery and payment.</p>
<p>● In early 2010, when the Exchange formally launched, just over three briefs per month were submitted. In Q2 2012 this had risen to nearly 60 per month from companies like  the AA, Coral, Exceed, Fantasy World, Red Commerce, Harvey Nichols, the Financial Times, Berlitz, Butlins, GE Healthcare and Tyco. Over the same time, average brief value has grown from approximately $1,500 in 2010 to an average for 2012 YTD of $11,000. Now more than 1,000 briefs have been submitted with a combined brief value of over $13.5 million, with these briefs coming from the US, UK, Europe, Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>● Today, blur Group has over 20,000 experts, agencies and service provider firms in over 130 countries on six crowd platforms who benefit from networking, peer advice as well as new business opportunities.
