<p>Samsung also continues to be a key component provider for Apple but, with DRAM chip prices declining, its mobile division is doing the heavy lifting &#8212; accounting for around two-thirds of its total profit in Q3, according to the Reuters report.</p>
<p>The news agency notes that most analysts expect Samsung&#8217;s run of four record quarters to come to an end in Q4 when Samsung ramps up marketing costs to combat rival smartphones such as Apple&#8217;s iPhone 5 in the battle for holiday sales. Another factor expected to eat into Samsung&#8217;s profits is that record profits will trigger higher performance-related payouts to some staff. The company is expecting record profit of 28 trillion won ($25 billion) this year.</p>
<p>Samsung, which has a market cap of around $183 billion, expects profits at its mobile division to have more than doubled in Q3 &#8212; to around 5 trillion won &#8212; as smartphone shipments exceed 58 million, including up to 20 million unit sales of its latest flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S III. Operating profit is estimated to have jumped 91 percent to 8.1 trillion won from the year ago period &#8212; a jump which Reuters notes beats an average forecast of 7.6 trillion won in its survey of 16 analysts. Q3 revenue is estimated at 52 trillion won, in line with forecasts.</p>
<p>Samsung will report audited results for its Q3 financial quarter on October 26.</p>
