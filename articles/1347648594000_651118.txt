That leaves Windows 8 as the only operating system that will run on the <a target="_blank" href="http://newsroom.intel.com/community/intel_newsroom/blog/2012/09/11/intel-low-power-processors-to-fuel-future-of-mobile-computing-innovation?wapkw=clover+trail">Clover Trail Atom</a> chip.</p>
<p>To be clear, Linux can run on Clover Trail because it is an x86 chip. But it&#8217;s unlikely any device maker will want to go to the trouble to do it. Instead, Intel is giving Windows 8 the advantage of being the only OS that Clover Trail will support.</p>
<p>Intel confirmed at its developer forum this week that it would not support Linux for Clover Trail.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2205462/idf-intel-says-clover-trail-will-not-work-with-linux">The Inquirer</a> says the issue may be due to the power issues with the chip. An Intel engineer said it&#8217;s a lot of work to provide additional OS support. So, it&#8217;s entirely possible that support may come at a later point. Still, the reasons for leaving out Linux are not so readily apparent.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, the news shows how far behind Microsoft is in the mobile race. Essentially, Intel is giving Microsoft a handicap in the market. But it&#8217;s questionable if the strategy will work.</p>
<p>Microsoft is in a deep hole due to its stumbling in the mobile market. Intel may be giving Windows 8 a bit of an advantage, but the competition is still quite fierce with Apple iOS and Google Android.</p>
<p>The big question for me is the enterprise market. Apple is killing it in the corporate world. Microsoft is supposed to have this breakthrough Windows 8 tablet that has the enterprise in mind. This handicap does not seem to do much to help fill that gap.</p>
