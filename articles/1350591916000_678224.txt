First it was its <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/18/googles-stock-takes-a-dive-after-mid-day-earnings-release-trading-halted/">earnings being leaked by its printer</a>. Then it was a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/18/chromebook-samsung-249/">product announcement that leaked</a> before its planned embargo time. And now, YouTube is down.
