First it was its <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/18/googles-stock-takes-a-dive-after-mid-day-earnings-release-trading-halted/">earnings being leaked by its printer</a>. Then it was a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/18/chromebook-samsung-249/">product announcement that leaked</a> before its planned embargo time. And now, YouTube is down. Right before Google&#8217;s earnings call, which is hosted on &#8212; yep, you guessed it &#8212; YouTube. </p>
<p><em>(Updating as we learn more&#8230;)</em></p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Annnnnndddddd&#8230; It&#8217;s back. I want to thank all my coworkers for alerting me after I published but before I managed to dig in too deeply. </p>
<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> YouTube has issued the following statement: &#8220;Some users encountered errors, or a slower than normal experience on YouTube today. Our engineers worked quickly to address the issue and fixed the problem within minutes. We&#8217;re sorry for any inconvenience this caused our users.&#8221; </p>
<p>Glad to hear that there were engineers after all, and not trained monkeys, working on bringing YouTube back.</p>
<p>For those who care, this is what it looked like:</p>
