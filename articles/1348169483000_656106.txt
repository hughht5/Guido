TechCrunch was planning to talk to him at one of his usual digs at an Apple Store in Los Gatos or San Jose.  </p>
<p>But, this time it turns out the Apple co-founder is waiting in Australia.  According to <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/stevewoz/status/248841711005085696">his tweet</a> from an hour ago, he&#8217;s &#8220;in Line for first iPhone 5&#8242;s in the world!&#8221; at the Apple Store in Chermside, Queensland Australia, which is a suburb of Brisbane.  Where it happens to be 5am Friday.  So, Wozniak will be one of the first to buy the new iPhone 5.</p>

<p>According to the Apple <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/au/retail/chermside/">website</a>, the Chermside store opens in just a few hours at 9am.</p>
<p>When the iPhone 4S came out, he <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/14/steve-wozniak-on-how-the-iphone-4s-will-change-his-life-tctv/">told TechCrunch</a> how it would change his life.  He also explained why he waits on line, saying &#8220;I&#8217;ve gotten so used to waiting in line, overnight, it has meaning.  The product is so good and this is my way of recognizing it.&#8221;</p>
