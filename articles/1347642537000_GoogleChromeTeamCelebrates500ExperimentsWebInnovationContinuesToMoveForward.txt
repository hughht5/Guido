<p>Today, the Google Chrome team celebrated a milestone for its &#8220;Experiments&#8221; project that it launched in 2009. It&#8217;s a site that features some really great innovation for web browsers, highlighting HTML5 and WebGL. </p>
<p>The team said it reached 500 experiments, hoping to help move web innovation further. Here&#8217;s what they <a target="_blank" href="http://chrome.blogspot.com/2012/09/500-chrome-experiments.html">had to say about it</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today marks our 500th experiment, and in celebration, we created Experiment 500 as a thank you note to everyone who submitted their work to the site. It’s an array of interactive particles, each one of them corresponding to a different submission. You can sort them by date or by category. </p>
<p>As you browse the experiments, you’ll notice that Chrome Experiments has evolved along with the web in the last 3.5 years. After Google Chrome added support for WebGL, for example, we started seeing beautiful 3D graphics experiments like Evan Wallace’s WebGL Water Simulation and HelloEnjoy’s Lights. </p></blockquote>
