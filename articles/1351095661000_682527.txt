The bottom line is that people look to be interested in getting the latest hardware, and are divesting themselves of older models to make that happen.</p>
<p>Of the new trade-in volume since Tuesday, the latest, third-generation iPad accounted for 66 percent, while the iPad 2 was responsible for 28 percent of newly swapped devices, and the original iPad came in at just 6 percent. It&#8217;s interesting that the iPad 3 is leading the pack: this means a good chunk of people who just bought a new iPad last spring or sometime since are interested in getting a newer version.</p>
<p>Whether those buyers are looking for the iPad mini, or the beefed up fourth-generation iPad is hard to tell from these numbers alone, but we&#8217;ll see how initial sales progress during the holiday quarter to find out. I have to say, I&#8217;m tempted to swap out my third-generation iPad for the new Lightning-capable hotness myself, if only just to minimize my cable clutter. Anyone else making the switch?</p>
