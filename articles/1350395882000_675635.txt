Not to mention <a target="_blank" href="http://www.publicstuff.com/">Public Stuff</a>, which recently <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/09/publicstuff-5-million-funding/">raised $5 million</a>.</p>
<p>But Jon Axelrod, Managing Director of ERA is no fan of resting on laurels, and so the accelerator is making a few important changes.</p>
<p>With the January 2013 class, the accelerators&#8217; fourth class ever, ERA will bump the original $25,000 in seed funding to $40,000 per company. &#8220;We really believe that extra $15,000 can really make a difference,&#8221; said Axelrod.</p>
<p>But just because funding is getting a bump doesn&#8217;t mean there will be fewer companies in the program; ERA will still accept ten companies per class.</p>
<p>And if that weren&#8217;t enough, the accelerator is extending the program for an extra month, which means startups will have access to all the benefits of the accelerator for four months instead of three.</p>
<p>ERA has also told TechCrunch that they will begin to participate in second and third round investments where they see fit. This doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;ll lead any new rounds of funding for their companies, but they will now give themselves the option to participate as follow-on investors.</p>
<p>Applications are currently open for the ERA 2013 class, and hungry entrepreneurs can click <a target="_blank" href="http://eranyc.com/apply/">here</a> to get their app on.</p>
<p>Happy disrupting, everyone!</p>
