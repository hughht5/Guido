We&#8217;ve reached out to Twitter but haven&#8217;t been able to confirm this as of yet.</p>
<p>If true, this marks an important milestone for Twitter, which is in complete attack mode when it comes to turning into a media powerhouse. As it stands now, you can upload photos to attach to your tweets, thanks to Twitter&#8217;s own service, and it&#8217;s probably the easiest way to share photos on the service. Video is a logical next step for Twitter and the yet-to-be-released Vine, but this could get really tricky for the company, fast.</p>
<p>You see, you can already share photos and videos on services like Facebook and Google+. The major difference is that you can control who sees the content. On Twitter, you have two options: public or private. This means that people will make decisions to share or not share based on this limitation.</p>
<p>What am I getting at? We&#8217;re about to see some ridiculously embarrassing videos that aren&#8217;t meant for &#8220;prime time.&#8221; Moving pictures transcends everything, even a simple photo. A photo of someone about to moon a camera is different than a video of someone actually doing it.</p>

<p>Before you ask, &#8220;But what about services like Socialcam and Viddy? Same thing!&#8221; Not really, because Twitter&#8217;s game is distribution&#8230;fast distribution. Globally.</p>
<p>It makes sense for Twitter to get into this game, as it relies heavily on YouTube and other platforms to serve everyone&#8217;s followers with video. However, real-world people are going to make real-world mistakes.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example: Your friend is a bit drunk, and you shoot a beautiful video with your phone. In an instant, you and your friend decide &#8220;YOLO! I&#8217;m gonna share this.&#8221; You can&#8217;t take that back. Once it&#8217;s on Twitter, it&#8217;s all over the place. You can pull back something on YouTube, Google+ and Facebook, but not so easily on Twitter. It&#8217;s the mentality of users on the service &#8212; if we see it, it happened.</p>
<p>How can Twitter make this experience better by helping users save themselves from humiliation? I don&#8217;t know. Maybe that&#8217;s not their job. My point is that &#8220;doing video&#8221; isn&#8217;t just about providing some cloud storage and processing. A lot goes into making a solid video platform.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t used <a target="_blank" href="http://vine.co/">Vine</a>. I haven&#8217;t met the team. I&#8217;m hoping that if this is all true, Twitter has already begun thinking about the potential consequences.</p>
