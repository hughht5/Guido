The figure comes from Asian component suppliers to Apple &#8212; also the source of last week&#8217;s iPad mini story.</p>
<p>The paper quotes the suppliers as saying that Apple&#8217;s order for 10 million initial units of this smaller iPad is roughly double the size of the order placed by Amazon for its Kindle Fire tablets in the same quarter. If Apple is planning to launch a smaller iPad, it will be a direct competitor to Amazon&#8217;s small form-factor Kindle tablets and also <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/27/nexus-7/">Google&#8217;s Nexus 7</a>.</p>
<p>Apple hasn&#8217;t confirmed any of the myriad reports, rumours and speculation it&#8217;s planning to make a smaller iPad, so the existence of the device remains unconfirmed. However the WSJ has <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/03/making-sense-of-the-ipad-mini-rumors-what-to-expect-when-and-why/">a good record</a> for sourcing genuine pre-production leaks so evidence for the &#8216;iPad mini&#8217; continues to mount. The WSJ&#8217;s previous story suggested the device will have a 7.85 in screen (vs the 9.7 inch display on its current iPad) and a lower resolution than the third generation iPad &#8212; meaning it might not include Apple&#8217;s Retina Display technology.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Apple for an official response on the WSJ report and will update with any reply.</p>
<p>Last week we <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/01/report-ipad-mini-press-event-invitations-going-out-october-10/">also reported</a> an Apple investor&#8217;s assertion that Apple would be sending out invitations for a press event to launch the iPad mini on October 10, with the device due to ship on October 17.</p>
