<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/galnote2.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="galnote2" title="galnote2" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Like the Galaxy S III before it, Samsung has just announced that the new Galaxy Note II will indeed hit all five major U.S. carriers &#8212; AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile, U.S. Cellular, and Verizon Wireless &#8212; by the middle of this November.</p>
<p>Fine, I admit it, the company&#8217;s still being pretty vague here. As usual, Samsung has left it up to the carriers to announce exactly when the new-fangled phablet will hit their respective store shelves, but rest easy &#8212; those announcements are bound to start trickling out any minute now. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s also no official word on pricing (on contract or otherwise), but if the original is any indicator the Note II should launch with a price tag between $249 and $299.</p>
<p>Before we get too wrapped up in the details, let&#8217;s consider the hardware for just a moment &#8212; the Note II&#8217;s 5.5-inch Super AMOLED display and redesigned S-Pen may count among the device&#8217;s biggest draws, but its internals are worthy of some extra scrutiny here. While plenty of international handsets tend to get neutered once they make their way stateside, that thankfully doesn&#8217;t seem to be the case with the Note II. Samsung&#8217;s 1.6GHz quad-core Exynos chipset still runs the show here, while 2GB of RAM and an LTE radio help keep things moving at a snappy pace. </p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, the device is Samsung&#8217;s first to ship pre-loaded with Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, though the Korean company&#8217;s liberal application of TouchWiz may make that fact a tough one to discern at first glance. Of course, Samsung&#8217;s additions don&#8217;t end there: the full slew of S-Pen applications is present too, as are plenty of modifications and updates seen in the recently-launched Galaxy Note 10.1 (think increased S-Pen sensitivity, greater hover distance, and more).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that Samsung&#8217;s timing really couldn&#8217;t be any better &#8212; LG opened the doors to its latest press conference/domestic phone unveiling just an hour ago, and now its rival has announced availability for its newest top-tier Android handset. To top it all off, LG also just recently launched its own hulking handset &#8212; the LG Intuition &#8212; and was largely panned by critics. The poor guys just can&#8217;t catch a break.</p>
