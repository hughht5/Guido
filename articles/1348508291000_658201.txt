<p>Some Facebook users are seeing private messages written in 2009 and earlier showing up on viewable Timelines as messages &#8220;Posted by friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>We first heard reports of this through emails from readers. Anecdotally, this appears to be true, at least for me &#8212; I am currently seeing what appear to have been private messages on friends&#8217; Timelines. My own Timeline also now is showing pre-2009 direct messages. Not all users, however, are seeing the bug.</p>
<p>The issue appears to be showing up both here in the United States as well as internationally. Reports of this have been been published in French newspapers such as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lemonde.fr/technologies/article/2012/09/24/messages-prives-rendus-publics-et-plongeon-boursier-pour-facebook_1765038_651865.html"><em>Le Monde</em>,</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lematin.ch/high-tech/web/Facebook-publie-les-messages-prives-des-membres/story/11015793"><em>Le Matin</em></a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;prev=_t&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;twu=1&amp;u=http://www.metrofrance.com/high-tech/facebook-d-anciens-messages-prives-publies-sur-la-timeline/mlix!MDk3LU0hjxIQ/&amp;usg=ALkJrhiss0HsNxWyk-4YIdSV9Uaa0aPrjA"><em>Metro France</em></a>.</p>
