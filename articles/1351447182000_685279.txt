It also means that the inner-geek in all of us come out. Yes, it&#8217;s a fun holiday, and we love it because it brings out our creativity.</p>
<p>I mean, did you not see the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/26/heres-what-happens-when-geeks-who-like-path-get-overly-excited-about-halloween/">awesome Path Pumpkins, which I&#8217;ve dubbed Pathkins</a>?</p>
<p>Also, the color orange is awesome, but that&#8217;s besides the point. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/26/how-square-keeps-its-culture-cool-and-connected-its-an-app">Our friends at Square</a> are having fun with Halloween, specifically one engineer&#8217;s mom. She took a look at the plain old white Square reader and thought &#8220;I can jazz those up.&#8221; And jazz up she did, check these out:</p>
<blockquote class='twitter-tweet' lang='en'><p>My mom sent me a box of Halloween-themed @<a href="https://twitter.com/Square">Square</a> readers! <a href="http://t.co/MDCHiL0D" rel="nofollow">http://t.co/MDCHiL0D</a></p>&mdash; <br />Michael White (@mwwhite) <a href='http://twitter.com/#!/mwwhite/status/261511221377908736' data-datetime='2012-10-25T16:55:09+00:00'>October 25, 2012</a></blockquote>
<p>My favorite is the pirate with the hat. Nice work, mom!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the first time that Square employees have gone about fixin&#8217; up those readers in trade for Internet glory, check out the photos from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/square/the-office-champion/221336547882991">last year&#8217;s office champion Square reader dress-up contest</a>:</p>
