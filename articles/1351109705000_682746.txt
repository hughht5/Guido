<p>The company&#8217;s shares popped 16.5 percent in after-hours trading to $2.45 from today&#8217;s close of $2.12 on news that Zynga is finally getting into real casino gaming. Zynga said it was partnering with bwin.party, a real money gaming operator, to offer real online poker and casino games in the U.K. Even though Zynga can&#8217;t technically offer real money casino gaming in the U.S. because of regulations, international markets are still a multi-billion dollar opportunity that potentially dwarfs the current size of the social gaming industry.</p>
<p>The report also comes just a day after the company engaged in cost-cutting with <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/23/zynga-ceo-mark-pincus-confirms-layoffs-5-of-workforce-potential-closures-for-u-k-japan-offices/">lay offs for about 5 percent of its workforce</a>. The company decided to eliminate the Boston office and said it&#8217;s considering closing its U.K. and Japanese studios.</p>
<p>The company <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/04/zynga-lowers-outlook-for-2012-q3-cites-weakness-in-certain-games-including-the-ville/">foreshadowed these earnings earlier this month when it said it expected to report revenue</a> between $300 million to $305 million and bookings between $250 million to $255 million for the third quarter. Bookings are what players pay for upfront, while revenues divide that figure over a longer period of time since players might not actually use their virtual purchases until later.</p>
<p>Zynga had to downgrade its earnings expectations earlier this month because of poorer-than-expected performances from The Ville and Draw Something, the game it acquired in the $180 million OMGPOP deal. The company also said that it expected to see bookings for the year come in at between $1.085 billion to $1.100 billion (down from previous estimates of between $1.150 billion to $1.225 billion).</p>
<p>Zynga&#8217;s shares have fallen from a peak of $15.91 earlier this year to a current $2.12 as the company hasn&#8217;t been able to diversify its business away from Facebook fast enough to satisfy investors. At the same time, a number of higher-level ranking executives have left either because they vested and saw other opportunities in and outside of gaming or because they weren&#8217;t a good cultural fit with the company.</p>
