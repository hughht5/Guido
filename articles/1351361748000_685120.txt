<p>Google this morning officially canceled the Android event that was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/17/google-issues-invites-to-october-29th-nyc-android-event-says-the-playground-is-open/">scheduled to occur on Monday, October 29</a> in New York City due to Hurricane Sandy, which is expected to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/us/hurricane-sandy-on-collision-course-with-winter-storm.html?_r=1&amp;hp">hit the city on Sunday evening</a>. </p>
<p>In an email sent to reporters signed up to attend the event first <a target="_blank" href="http://marketingland.com/hurricane-sandy-causes-google-to-cancel-its-android-event-25134">picked up by Marketing Land&#8217;s Danny Sullivan</a>, Google issued a terse explanation:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We are canceling our Monday morning event in New York due to Hurricane Sandy. We will let you know our plans as soon as we know more.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Google PR for more detail on when the event may be rescheduled, and will be sure to update this with anything we hear.</p>
<p>The Android event was expected to compete for press attention with <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/04/microsofts-windows-phone-8-launch-event-happening-october-29-in-san-francisco/">Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Phone 8 launch</a> also planned for Monday October 29th. That event is still on, though, as it&#8217;s taking place in sunny San Francisco.</p>
