It&#8217;s the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1610299429/complete-dock-the-best-ipad-dock-and-more">CompleteDock</a>, and I had the chance to sneak a peek at an early, functional prototype at <a href="http://techcrunch.com/tag/disrupt/">Disrupt SF</a> this year.</p>
<p>I noticed it at a booth for a cloud services startup, and was immediately intrigued by its solid aluminum construction. It looked like a dock that was immovable, implacable, and designed to stand the test of time. And after going in for a closer look, it turns out that&#8217;s exactly what it was, but also with a unique, modal twist that means it can be used with just about any gadget out there.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it works: The CompleteDock&#8217;s business end (where it gets connected to its data/power cable) is swappable, meaning you can change it out for a 30-pin dock connector to USB cable, micro-USB, or an Apple iPhone 5 Lightning connector. These will be available to purchase separately in case you buy new devices, but there&#8217;s also another wonderful benefit for backers: The first change is free. Meaning when you change devices initially, you&#8217;re covered.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a support that can switch out to accommodate different devices and different angles, and both a mini and full-sized version, depending on your needs, but for my money the regular version looks great with either tablets or smartphones.</p>
<p>The best part? This is already a real device, which I saw, and handled in person thanks to project founder Gligor Dacevski. The company has a manufacturing facility with CNC machines ready to pump them out. Compared to a lot of projects I&#8217;ve backed, they&#8217;re way ahead of the game, and actually stand a fair chance of hitting their December 2012 ship date.</p>
<p>I actually miss using my iPhone 4S dock, and I haven&#8217;t found a suitable replacement. The Elevation Dock looks promising, especially with <a target="_blank" href="http://thenextweb.com/apple/2012/10/02/its-alive-elevation-dock-modified-work-apples-iphone-5-lightning-connector/?utm_medium=Spreadus&amp;awesm=tnw.to_c5Wj&amp;utm_campaign=social%20media&amp;utm_source=Twitter">its upcoming iPhone 5 compatibility update</a>, but the CompleteDock is more multi-purpose, and seems sturdier, too. Plus, this may be naive, but I&#8217;m hoping this is the last dock I&#8217;ll ever buy.
