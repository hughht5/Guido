The company has announced that it will <a target="_blank" href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120918006025/en/Nuance-Acquire-Ditech-Networks">acquire San Jose-based Ditech Networks</a> for $1.45 per share, which works out to a net total of $22.5 million. While the boards of both companies have signed off on the transaction, the deal isn&#8217;t expected to close until later this year. </p>
<p>I can&#8217;t blame you if <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ditechnetworks.com/index.php/home/company/about-ditech/#vqs">Ditech Networks</a> hasn&#8217;t popped up on your radar before &#8212; the company deals mostly with voice processing technology used by wireline service providers and mobile carriers, and counts AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint/Nextel, and China Unicom among its larger clients. It may not be the most compelling company you&#8217;ll hear about all day, but Nuance would probably beg to differ.</p>
<p>It seemed that Nuance was after two parts of Ditech&#8217;s portfolio in particular &#8212; the company&#8217;s PhoneTag voice-to-text service and its <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ditechnetworks.com/index.php/home/voice-quality-assurance/">voice quality assurance</a> tech. If Nuance&#8217;s release is any indication, the company seems to value the former just a bit more because of the highly &#8220;messaging-centric&#8221; nature of modern communications. According to Nuance Mobile VP John Pollard, Nuance and its carrier partners have worked to embrace voice recognition, as seen in the company&#8217;s &#8220;voicemail to text and call completion businesses, where billions of calls are converted into easily read text and email messages.&#8221;</p>
<p>While PhoneTag (and its customers) seem like a natural fit for Nuance, voice quality assurance is more of a network play geared toward improving the quality of calls by adjusting echo and reducing background noise in real time. At this point, it&#8217;s unclear how exactly Nuance plans into integrate that particular bit into its own (considerable) product base. I&#8217;ve reached out to representatives from both Nuance and Ditech, and will update once I learn more. </p>
