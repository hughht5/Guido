The answer, in Matthieu Vaxelaire&#8217;s case, is help out some other would-be entrepreneurs by launching a not-for-profit to give away 1,000 bundles of free web tools, each worth more than $10,000. These <a target="_blank" href="http://www.startuppack.org/">Startup Packs</a> are available to startups that have launched in the last two years and raised no more than £250,000 in funding &#8212; largely on a first come, first served basis.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s in the packs? Everything you might need to launch a startup, says Vaxelaire &#8212; specifically:</p>
<p>1. Zendesk: to manage customer support &#8212; 12 months for free<br />
2. Box: to share files online &#8212; 12 months for free for 3 users<br />
3. Mailjet: to send transactional emails &#8212; 12 months for free<br />
4. TextMaster: to translate all your documents &#8212; 10,000 credits for free<br />
5. Twilio: to bring voice and messaging to your web &#8212; $134 for free<br />
6. Engine Yard: to host your website &#8212; $500 for free<br />
7. Mixpanel: to analyze your website &#8212; 12 months for free<br />
8. Mention: to monitor your brand &#8212; 12 months for free for 3 users<br />
9. Pressking: to distribute your press release &#8212; 1,000 credits for free<br />
10. HotGloo: to collaborate on design &#8212; 12 months for free<br />
11. Fotolia: to get beautiful pictures &#8212; 60 images XL for free<br />
12. The Resumator: to hire with confidence &#8212; 12 months for free</p>
<p>After the free trial periods elapse, many of the web tools and services will continue to offer a discount to the startups, according to Vaxelaire. He says it&#8217;s a win-win for both the budding startups, who get some free stuff, and the startups who are giving their services away for free, as they get the oxygen of good-cause related publicity. (Doubtless it&#8217;s good for Vaxelaire too, to raise his profile ahead of his next startup project &#8212; having shut down <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kicktable.com/">Kicktable</a>, his previous startup).</p>
<p>Vaxelaire says a second giveaway of Startup Packs may take place in 2013, depending on the success of the first bundle and how much free time he has (he&#8217;s running the initiative in his spare time, with help from friends).</p>
<p>&#8220;Convincing all business partners was not easy,&#8221; he adds.</p>
