The news was announced in a blog post, which founders Jason Mendelson, Brad Feld, Seth Levine and Ryan McIntyre note was the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.foundrygroup.com/wp/2010/10/foundry-group-version-2-0/">exact same one</a> it used to announced its last fund, also for $225 million. (No use in breaking things that work, right?) This is the third fund raised by the group.</p>
<p>The news was also reported in <a target="_blank" href="http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2012/09/14/foundry-group-raises-225-million/">Fortune</a>, which writes that because there is still money let in that previous fund, Foundry won&#8217;t be drawing from the new fund probably until late this year or Q1 of next year.</p>
<p>The Foundry Group invests in early-stage North American-based software and IT companies, along a philosophy that it outlined back in 2008 and that it calls &#8220;thematic investing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The themes we pursue tend to be horizontal in nature and are often driven by underlying technology protocols and standards or emerging market trends and customer needs. Rather than looking for short-term hits, we focus on themes that have the ability to drive a cycle of innovation (and hence provide multiple investment opportunities) over a period of five to ten years or more,&#8221; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.foundrygroup.com/wp/2008/11/what-does-foundry-group-invest-in/">they write</a> in their sort-of manifesto. These are not exactly product categories but concepts and cover areas like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.foundrygroup.com/blog/archives/2008/03/theme-human-computer-interacti.php">Human Computer Interaction</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.foundrygroup.com/blog/archives/2008/03/theme-implicit-web.php">Implicit Web</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.foundrygroup.com/blog/archives/2008/04/did-darwin-skip-over-email.php">Email</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.foundrygroup.com/blog/archives/2008/03/theme-glue.php">Glue</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.foundrygroup.com/blog/archives/2008/05/theme-digital-life.php">Digital Life</a>, they noted at the time.
