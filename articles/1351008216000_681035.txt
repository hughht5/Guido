We literally have about a decade before printed books are gone &#8211; and I&#8217;m giving us a good long time to destroy what Gutenberg hath wrought &#8211; and soon digital content will be the norm. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s scary to think that, with an arbitrary keystroke, publishers will be able to delete our digital libraries in a second.</p>
<p>I doubt, quite sincerely, that Amazon and B&amp;N will truly begin using their orbital nuke system on many users. They simply can&#8217;t afford the bad will. However, the problem is in the publishers. Rights management is such a mess &#8211; especially in Europe &#8211; that it is no wonder these issues come mostly from cross-border rights disputes.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s next? Besides wholesale piracy of ebooks, honest ebook owners need to ready themselves for a bit of self-preservation.</p>
<p>First, be prepared to strip DRM from your ebooks. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/01/how-to-strip-drm-from-kindle-e-books-and-others/">Charlie Sorrel</a> has a good introductory lesson at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/01/how-to-strip-drm-from-kindle-e-books-and-others/">Wired</a> but in short you use <a target="_blank" href="http://calibre-ebook.com">Calibre</a> and some <a target="_blank" href="http://apprenticealf.wordpress.com/2012/09/10/drm-removal-tools-for-ebooks/">DRM software</a>. The process is fairly frustrating, but if you&#8217;re serious about maintaining your freedom it&#8217;s important to at least learn how to do it.</p>
<p>Second, back up your reader. Most readers allow you to connect your device to a computer where it appears as a drive. You can easily move the files there &#8211; usually <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/AZW">AZW</a> files for Kindle devices and ePub for iBooks and Nook devices &#8211; from the device to a local folder in case your Kindle is broken or shut down. Drag these files out to a backup drive and keep them safe. They are, in short, evidence that you bought some books.</p>

<p>Third, vote with your wallet. Support indie writers. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.humblebundle.com">Pick up a DRM free Indie bundle</a>. Pay for books by unknown writers, even if it&#8217;s a few dollars. We are entering an era of potentially uncurated writing. Focus on writers you like and pay for their work online. Support DRM-free bookstores. If we want to recreate the free and easy world of second-hand bookstores digitally, this is ultimately the only way to do it &#8211; through experimentation and respect for craft.</p>
<p>There will be a day &#8211; and it&#8217;s not far off &#8211; that the ebook will be the de facto standard. There will always be paperbacks and hardbacks. There will always be a deep legacy in the printed word. But the next big author will be an ebook author and a decade from now, few will remember or even understand how we once lugged around thick shanks of paper just to enjoy a bestseller.</p>
