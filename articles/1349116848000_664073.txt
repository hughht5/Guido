California, whose massive university system <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fairtest.org/new-sat-better-test-or-just-marketing-ploy">was influential enough to change the SAT for the entire country</a>, will now fund an inter-university council to produce 50 freely available digital textbooks for common lower division courses&#8211;perhaps spelling the end of college textbooks.</p>
<p>Yet, it seems silly that after a decade with near universal access to the sum of all human knowledge, we should be confined to textbooks at all. Textbooks are a disastrously bad way to learn: they assume humans learn through memorizing giant blocks of content; that all students learn at the same chapter-by-chapter speed; and textbooks don&#8217;t lend themselves to exploratory learning. Having co-designed and taught a course at the University of California, Irvine, where Internet research replaced the textbook, I know that collaborative, project-based learning can work. But a deeper look at the kooky system of higher education reveals why students are still tethered to textbooks.</p>
<p><strong>1. Learning Is Not A Priority</strong></p>
<p>Colleges aren&#8217;t punished when students don&#8217;t learn. According <em>Academically Adrift</em>, after 4 years of instruction, most students show little mastery of critical thinking or communication, as measured by the ability to read a newspaper and form an opinion. In part, this is because professors get paid to research, not teach. &#8220;There&#8217;s a huge incentive set up in the system [for] asking students very little, grading them easily, entertaining them, and your course evaluations will be high,&#8221; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.npr.org/2011/02/09/133310978/in-college-a-lack-of-rigor-leaves-students-adrift">admitted</a> co-author Richard Arum. Indeed, 35 percent of students reported studying fewer than five hours a week. Colleges get the same amount of funding, regardless of how little students learn.</p>
<p>Textbooks are a devious, implicit agreement between students and teachers that give the impression of learning: students stare at the pages while professors get to recycle old lectures based on the textbook during their weekly hour of &#8220;teaching.&#8221;</p>
<p>While <a target="_blank" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tl.86/abstract">surveys find</a> that most professors agree that lecture-based learning is vastly inferior, every attempt at actually changing this meets the &#8220;realities of the research universities’ continuing emphases on research productivity.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>2. High School Students Aren&#8217;t Prepared For Critical Thinking</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I like the idea of thinking critically, but I&#8217;m really good at regurgitating information,&#8221; a student once admitted to me, in a Psychology class I designed at the University of California, where students would use academic research to come up with policy prescriptions. To be honest, the initial trial of a textbook-less class was too overwhelming: students didn&#8217;t have basic comprehension of the scientific method or the ability to identify an argument. In other words, students didn&#8217;t have the requisite knowledge to effectively use Internet research, and needed the hand-holding guidance of a dumb-downed textbook.</p>
<p>Eventually, we taught students how to understand Internet research, but as per #1, most professors have neither the time nor patience for the kinds of remedial training that should be done in high school.</p>
<p>In conclusion, California textbooks are a nice feature and will save college students some much-needed cash, especially during the formative years when they are most susceptible to dropping out. But, don&#8217;t be tempted into believing that digital textbooks are a win for education, the economy, or democracy.</p>
