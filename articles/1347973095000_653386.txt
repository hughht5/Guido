<p>The Perceptual Networks&#8217; site seems to be login-only, but from the description in this <a target="_blank" href="http://www.philly.com/philly/business/20120918_PhillyDeals__Two_entrepreneurs_see_market_for_new_networking_system.html">Philadelphia Inquirer report</a>, the startup appears to be focused on social discovery and mobile.</p>
<p>The startup which was co-founded by HotOrNot and I/O Ventures founder Jim Young, is developing a suite of products to make it easy for people to find the people they best connect with, whether they are looking for the right co-workers or employees, the right relationship, the right friends and activity partners or the right community to live in.</p>
<p>Pereceptual co-founder and CEO Cheyenne Ehrlich, said in a release &#8220;Your community, friends, co-workers and life partner, if you have one, collectively have such a huge impact on the quality of your life. We want to make the process of finding and developing that community of people as easy as possible, for everyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Young <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2007/05/08/hot-or-not-tears-itself-apart-reinvents/">founded HotorNot</a> in 2000 and sold the site for <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2008/02/11/hotornot-apparently-very-hot-acquired-for-20-million/">$20 million in 2008.</a> Clearly investors are betting that he has another win.</p>
