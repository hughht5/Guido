The company also provided a trading update for the all-important holiday period encompassed by Q4 and the numbers are not pretty: it anticipates revenues of NT$60 billion, or $2 billion.</p>
<p>The company does not report how many handsets it has sold, but figures out today from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20121025007003/en/Smartphones-Drive-Quarter-Growth-Worldwide-Mobile-Phone">IDC</a> put the number at 7.3 million for the quarter, a decline of 42.5% on last year. It still manages to get into the top-five handset makers with a 4% share. Still, it is proving no match for rival Android maker Samsung, which has over a 30% share of the world&#8217;s smartphone market with estimated shipments of 56.3 million handsets for the quarter.</p>
<p>These numbers put HTC&#8217;s strategy to launch <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/26/htc-sweetens-the-deal-for-its-windows-and-one-phones-with-daily-deals-service-in-europe-with-living-social-trip-advisor-and-10-others/">daily deals in Europe</a>, announced today, into perspective: the company is trying to focus on services not only as an alternative revenue stream, but as a way of driving users to its devices.</p>
<p>In its overview, HTC noted, as it did last quarter, that China continues to be a major driver of business for the company. That will point to HTC looking at selling lower and lower-cost handsets, I suspect, since these are the primary driver of sales in that market, especially in the uber-competitive area of Android-based handsets. (iPhone is another story, catering as it does to the premium market.) In any case, offering lower-cost handsets will also hit right at HTC&#8217;s margin.</p>
<p>And that margin is not looking very good: it says the margin for Q3 was 25%, down 3% since last year. HTC expects gross margin for Q4 to be 23%.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in other markets, HTC says that the U.S. is &#8220;in line with expectations&#8221;: Europe is &#8220;focused on enhancing brand consideration&#8221; (? developing brand profile, I suppose); and the company continues to invest in South Asia. But it does not break out the performance in those individual regions.</p>
<p>Operating profit is at its lowest point in five quarters, currently standing at NT$4.9 billion, versus NT$20.2 billion a year ago, a drop of 54%.</p>
<p>HTC has continued to push ahead with investments and launches to turn things around. They include two new Windows Phone 8 handsets that will be coming to market in November as well as a $35 million strategic investment for 17% of enterprise platform maker Magnet Systems. But it also took a charge of $40 million in its OnLive cloud-based gaming investment when that company hit bankruptcy and needed to restructure (as a new OnLive).</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, all has had a big impact on its cash position, which is now at NT$202 million, down 23% on a year ago.</p>
