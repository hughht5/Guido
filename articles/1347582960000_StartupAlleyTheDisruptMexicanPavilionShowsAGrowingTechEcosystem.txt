<p>The great thing about country-based pavilions at TechCrunch Disrupt is that one can see innovation and new tech companies coming from countries you might not have associated with startups before. As you will have read in this guest <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/03/mexico-is-happening-at-techcrunch-disrupt/">post</a> by Eduardo Serrano last week, the shift towards emerging markets shows that Mexico is on its way up in tech. A short flight from Silicon Valley, Mexico’s economy is growing 40% faster than Brazil’s, over twice as fast as the United States, and is already the world’s 14th largest economy (on a GDP based scale). One out of 5 Mexicans now owns a smartphone, and the market will have grown 70% in the next 2 years. Some 40 million Mexicans are connected to the Internet today. </p>
