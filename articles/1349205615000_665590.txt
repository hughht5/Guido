Earlier this month, the American Civil Liberties Union <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security-technology-and-liberty/new-justice-department-documents-show-huge-increase">reported</a> that wiretapping has nearly quadrupled under President Obama. After Senate Democrats <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/05/congress-goes-on-recess-without-cybersecurity-law/">refused to pass</a> a cybersecurity law for America&#8217;s infrustructure installations, such as power plants, the Obama administration is <a target="_blank" href="http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/251409-lofgren-to-white-house-search-social-networks-should-be-exempt-from-cyber-order">reportedly penning</a> an executive order to push through some of the measures.</p>
<p>Proponents of warrantless spying argue that faster criminals require faster response times, such as the need to find a missing child before it became too late. “It may be that legislative action is needed to keep the law current in our rapidly evolving electronic age,” Brown wrote [<a target="_blank" href="http://gov.ca.gov/docs/SB_1434_Veto_Message.pdf">PDF</a>], “but I am not convinced that this bill strikes the right balance between the operational needs of law enforcement and the individual expectation of privacy.”</p>
<p>Specifically, California law SB 1434 would have required a search warrant to track suspects through their proximity to cell phone towers, a plan-B for law enforcement after courts <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/03/feds-move-to-cell-site-data/">denied them the ability to covertly affix GPS tracking devices</a> to their cars.</p>
<p>When cybersecurity fails at the federal level, it falls to states. On this one-of-a-kind privacy law, California has sided with the president that new threats demand different expectations of privacy. What do you think? Is safety worth the privacy tradeoff?</p>
