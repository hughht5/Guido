And it&#8217;s using a pretty prominent call-out box to do it. This evening, I noticed on the homepage of my Twitter account, in the place where you would normally see your profile and Tweet window, a new box: &#8220;Send Tweets to Facebook,&#8221; said the call-out. &#8220;Share your Tweets with your friends on Facebook.&#8221; A button takes you to your profile page to enable that to happen.</p>
<p>My colleague Drew told me it suddenly appeared for him, too. And it <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/i/#!/search/realtime/'send%20tweets%20to%20facebook'">looks like others are seeing the same note as well</a> (none too happily, it seems).</p>
<p></p>
<p>We know, we know: the ability to send Tweets to Facebook is not new. And you may have even at some point seen this the callout panel in the past for things you haven&#8217;t done yet to your Twitter account, such as uploading a profile image, or finding your Gmail contacts.</p>
<p>But it looks like the Facebook feature may be getting a bit more attention from Twitter right now.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, Twitter declined to confirm whether it is the case that this callout suddenly started to make a more frequent appearance, but in a week where we&#8217;ve seen the launch of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/18/reminder-apples-ios-6-arrives-tomorrow-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">iOS 6</a>, the launch of a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/18/twitter-announces-new-design-with-focus-on-profile-pages-ipad-update-on-the-today-show/">new Twitter app</a>, and a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/tag/facebook/">whole bunch of Facebook updates</a>, perhaps Twitter thought it would be a good time to get people to try out some new functionality &#8212; and maybe pick up a little referral traffic (good for it&#8217;s ad business, you know) in the process, Facebook being an important driver of referral traffic for other sites (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.journalism.org/analysis_report/facebook_becoming_increasingly_important">specifically media</a>) for a while now.</p>
<p>Given Twitter CEO Dick Costolo&#8217;s comments this week on PBS earlier this week describing an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/apple-is-our-mentor-facebook-is-our-enemy-says-twitter-ceo-dick-costolo-8156702.html">adversarial</a> relationship with Facebook &#8212; they go after the same social marketing ad dollars &#8212; this may also be Twitter&#8217;s way of saying to Facebook: no hard feelings, eh?</p>
