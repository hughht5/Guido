And it&#8217;s using a pretty prominent call-out box to do it. This evening, I noticed on the homepage of my Twitter account, in the place where you would normally see your profile and Tweet window, a new box: &#8220;Send Tweets to Facebook,&#8221; said the call-out. &#8220;Share your Tweets with your friends on Facebook.&#8221; A button takes you to your profile page to enable that to happen.</p>
<p>My colleague Drew told me it suddenly appeared for him, too. And it <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/i/#!/search/realtime/'send%20tweets%20to%20facebook'">looks like others are seeing the same note as well</a> (none too happily, it seems).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>We know, we know: the ability to send Tweets to Facebook is not new. And you may have even at some point seen this the callout panel in the past for things you haven&#8217;t done yet to your Twitter account, such as uploading a profile image, or finding your Gmail contacts.</p>
<p>But it looks like the Facebook feature may be getting a bit more attention from Twitter right now.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, Twitter declined to confirm whether that is the case, but in a week where we&#8217;ve seen the launch of iOS 6, the launch of a new Twitter app, and a whole bunch of Facebook updates, perhaps Twitter thought it would be a good time to get people to try out some new functionality &#8212; and maybe pick up a little referral traffic in the process, Facebook being an important driver of referral traffic for other sites (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.journalism.org/analysis_report/facebook_becoming_increasingly_important">specifically media</a>) for a while now.</p>
