<p>Here is an unintended dark side to a search engine that only provides the information we want to see: it cocoons us in an echo chamber of political information that confirms our pre-existing opinions. Google competitor, DuckDuckGo, <a target="_blank" href="http://idealab.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/10/impersonal-google-search-results-are-few-and-far-between-duckduckgo-finds.php?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+tpm-idea-lab+%28TPM+Idea+Lab%29">released a tiny study</a> showing how Google&#8217;s personalized search yielded wildly different results on abortion and gun control, even for users that weren&#8217;t logged on to a Google service. &#8220;You search for raw information, but you&#8217;re getting more of what you already agree with,&#8221; says a clever advertisement from the company.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/12/personalized-search-for-everyone.html">Since 2009</a>, Google has pushed personalized search for every user, increasingly adding more data to tailor results, including location and search history. Google <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=mmQl6VGvX-c">argues</a> that personalization is essential, since the only way to know whether a search for &#8220;Taj Mahal&#8221; was for the building in India or <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taj_Mahal_(musician)">the jazz musician</a>, is to make an informed guess about the user&#8217;s intentions.</p>
<p>Personalization has unintended consequences for political information, where it&#8217;s commonly assumed that citizens need a balanced perspective&#8211;whether they like it or not. DuckDuckGo, however, found in a tiny study of 100 volunteers, personalized Google results for &#8220;abortion&#8221; yielded Obama&#8217;s stance on abortion for some, and information on pro-life activist, Gianna Jessen, for others. Political partisanship may thus be another unintended consequence of collecting private information.</p>
<p>The echo-chamber argument is not new. Legal scholar and former White House officer, Cass Sunstein, called this the &#8220;cyberbalkanization&#8221; (or &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splinternet">splinternet</a>&#8221; if brevity is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Be7Og9Gc_KY">your thing</a>). Research, however, finds that we&#8217;re not as aggressively partisan as some worry. Scholars who conduct large scale tracking of users news reading habits <a target="_blank" href="http://wapor2012.hkpop.hk/doc/papers/ConcurrentSessionsVI/VIA/VIA-3.pdf">find little evidence</a> of partisan information seeking (more research <a target="_blank" href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/h03541w2243lk780/">here</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2009.01440.x/full">here</a>). &#8220;There is no evidence that individuals abandon news stories that contain information with which they disagree. Implications and directions for future research are discussed,&#8221; <a target="_blank" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2009.01440.x/abstract">writes</a> Ohio University Professor, Kelly Garrett.</p>
<p>In Google&#8217;s case, personalized search is <em>un</em>intentional partisanship, which could result in a spiral of ever-more self-confirming information. DuckDuckGo would have to make the case that this holds up in experimental conditions <em>and</em> has an affect on civic knowledge and voting behavior. As we see above, it&#8217;s easy to make a theoretical article about the impacts of the Internet, but it&#8217;s quite another to prove they&#8217;re actually true.</p>
<p>Still, it&#8217;s worth studying, because the implications of personalized search could be very troubling for our democracy.</p>
