Those two devices will be Windows 8 powered. Two screen sizes are available, 11&#8243; and 13&#8243;. The 13&#8243; model is the first hybrid laptop that meets the Ultrabook requirements.</p>
<p>The 13-inch model features a Core i7 ULV processor, a 1600&#215;900 16:9 screen resolution, Intel HD 4000 Graphics, up to 256GB SSD storage and up to 8GB of RAM. It has a USB 3.0 connector built-in and more traditional connectivity features such as a USB 2.0 connector, a SD card reader, a HDMI output and Bluetooth 4.0. All of this comes in a 1.54kg (3.40 ounces) package.</p>
<p>The 11-inch model, on the other hand, will trade the Intel processor for an ARM-based NVIDIA Tegra 3 (T30) processor. It comes with 2 GB of RAM and a mere 64 GB of flash storage. It feels limited in capacity compared to its bigger brother who sure looks like more interesting. It still weighs 1.27kg (2.8 ounces). But Lenovo promises 13 hours of battery life, which could attract some users for potential niche cases.</p>
<p>The two devices will be available starting October 12 respectively for $1,099 and $799 for the default configuration.</p>
