The good old ThinkPad brand is used once again for another model, the ThinkPad Twist. It is a 12.5&#8243; tablet/laptop hybrid powered by a third-generation Intel Core i7 processor.</p>
<p>The mechanism is different from the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/09/lenovo-introduces-the-ideapad-yoga-11-and-13-the-first-tablet-laptop-ultrabook-hybrid/">IdeaPad Yoga</a> models. In that case, you flip the screen horizontally before &#8220;closing&#8221; the laptop with the display on the top. Let&#8217;s hope it&#8217;s sturdy enough for business-oriented users.</p>
<p>The ThinkPad Twist will sport a 320/500 GB hard drive, or optionally a 128 GB SSD. At 12.5 inches and with a 1366 x 768 resolution, the display doesn&#8217;t look as appealing as the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/09/lenovo-introduces-the-ideapad-yoga-11-and-13-the-first-tablet-laptop-ultrabook-hybrid/">IdeaPad Yoga 13&#8242;s</a>.</p>
<p>The two USB ports will be USB 3.0-compatible, and an Ethernet port will still be available for those who still rely on the technology. Other tech specs include up to 8 GB of RAM and up to seven hours of battery life.</p>
<p>At the press event, Lenovo stated that they want to become the No. 1 PC maker in the world. We&#8217;ll see if they will achieve that status with those new models as the ThinkPad Twist will come out in October.</p>
