It also now offers dictionary updates for relevant trending &#8216;hot words&#8217; &#8212; so you can take other people&#8217;s slang with you too. Fortunately the latter is an opt-in feature.</p>
<p>The latest Swype update is more of a minor &#8216;spit and polish&#8217; than the major  <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/20/nuance-supercharges-swype-adds-new-keyboard-options-xt9-predictive-text-and-dragon-powered-voice-input/">update released back in June</a> &#8211; which added multiple input methods including a voice-to-text option, XT9 predictive text for those who do want to tap out each letter, and the ability to handwrite characters and have them converted to text (useful for character-based languages such as Chinese). That update also introduced a personalised dictionary &#8212; something Nuance is building on now by letting users sync their slang across all their Swype-friendly devices. <i style="font-weight:bold;"><br />

<p>Other new features included in the latest version are three different versions of the Swype keyboard for tablets &#8212; so you can choose between using the original Swype keyboard; a small, moveable keyboard; or a split screen keyboard. Having different sizes and types of keyboard on tablets is important since the larger form factor of some slates can make Swype&#8217;s finger-dragging input method slower than classic touch-typing.</p>
<p>The new version also adds the ability to customise the look of the keyboard by choosing one of 10 different themes. And there are some language-related updates too &#8212; with enhancements to Swype&#8217;s Chinese and Japanese keyboards, and more languages getting its Advanced Language Models which is used to predict the words and phrases Swype users write the most.</p>
<p>Swype comes preinstalled on lots of Android phones &#8212; but can also be downloaded via <a target="_blank" href="http://beta.swype.com/">beta.swype.com</a> (from tomorrow) to devices it&#8217;s not already installed on (albeit it won&#8217;t work on every piece of Android hardware). The software is also offered for download to Symbian phones, and comes pre-installed on some MeeGo devices.</p>
<p>Swype is not available for iOS (<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/07/swype-iphone/">unless you jail break</a>) or for Windows Phone.</p>
