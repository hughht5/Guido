<p>I tend to take naps everywhere — on park benches, at my kitchen table after lunch, and most certainly on the subway. In fact, I&#8217;m convinced that I have some sort of sleep disorder, despite my doctor&#8217;s insistence to the contrary. But with or without some official diagnosis, I seem to have stumbled across the sweet elixir to my napping happiness.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s called the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ostrich-pillow/ostrich-pillow">Ostrich Pillow</a>, and even though it&#8217;s been around for about a year, it only recently made its way on to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ostrich-pillow/ostrich-pillow">Kickstarter</a>. It&#8217;s essentially a giant oversized hat, that stretches all the way from the top of your head down to the crown of your shoulders, with a small hole for your nose and mouth, and holes up top for your hands.</p>
<p>The idea is that, as napping becomes more and more commonplace in work environments, users can strap on their ostrich pillow and doze off for a power nap. It seems to have everything covered, except it appears to lack proper neck support. I&#8217;ll need to get my hands (err.. head?) in one to find out, but based on the pictures you may wake up with quite the crick.</p>
<p>Here at TechCrunch, one of our fearless leaders <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/15/the-girl-who-couldnt-nap-and-said-she-never-had-to/">has discovered</a> that a solid nap during the work day actually improves performance, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/03/napcrunch/">much to her surprise</a>.</p>
<p>Other companies are also jumping on the nap time bandwagon, including Google and Cisco. According to <a target="_blank" href="http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2011/08/18/why-companies-are-cozying-up-to-napping-at-work/">Fortune</a>, 6 percent of companies included nap rooms in their facilities in 2011, and 34 percent of ~1,500 respondents were allowed to nap at work.</p>
<p>Oh, I almost forgot&#8230; <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/21/sleep-tight-sweet-romain-youve-earned-it/">Romain, our intern, also sleeps at work</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the beginning of a new era my friends.</p>
