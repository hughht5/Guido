<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/outbid.jpeg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="outbid" title="outbid" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.outbid.com">Outbid&#8217;s</a> real-time mobile auctions are neat enough as is, but the company has just pushed out an iOS app update that packs a much-needed feature to make the auction experience complete &#8212; users can now hear live auctioneers hawking their goods.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s back up a bit first. In case you&#8217;re not yet familiar, Outbid allows users to create fee-free auctions through which they can sell their junk. A familiar concept to be sure &#8212; I still can&#8217;t quite believe eBay has been around since 1995 &#8212; but Outbid&#8217;s big draw is that it turns that auction into an interactive spectacle that&#8217;s typically over in minutes as opposed to hours or days.</p>
<p>Every time a user places another bid, additional time is added to a big clock smack in the middle of the screen &#8212; it&#8217;s not entirely unlike QuiBid&#8217;s system, except (y&#8217;know) much less shady. As silly as it sounds, things get awfully tense whenever someone throws their hat into the ring at the last minute too.</p>
<p>The ability for a seller (or a designated helper) to narrate the auction has been a hallmark of Outbid&#8217;s web app, and now iOS users can get in on the fun as well. That said, you can&#8217;t actually commentate on an auction from your iOS device just yet, so those limber lips will need to wait until you&#8217;re ready to run an auction from your desktop.</p>
<p>The update also packs some visual enhancements for iPad users &#8212; bigger buttons for easier bidding, as well as the ability to swipe to bring up more information about the product you&#8217;re bidding on. Oh, and just in case you&#8217;re not very good at the whole process, there&#8217;s a new demo mode just to get you into the swing of things. Thoughtful, no?</p>
