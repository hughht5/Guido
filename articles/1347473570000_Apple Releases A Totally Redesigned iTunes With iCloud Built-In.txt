<p>As with every new hardware releases, Apple updated iTunes. But the media software received a major update today. The interface is now totally new with an edge-to-edge design. Browsing your music feels completely different with a great emphasis on album art. The left-side column is gone in the default configuration. But the most important improvement is that iCloud is now built-in.</p>
<p>You can switch back to a more traditional interface with listings of your music available and browse by artist. The interface is much clearer with pop-up elements that look like iOS. Search was improved.</p>
<p>A new feature called &#8220;Up next&#8221; will be available. The name suggests that it should work like the queue feature in Spotify. </p>
<p>The mini-player was redesigned. You can now search directly from the mini-player and even manage playlists. The iTunes Store was redesigned as well and looks a lot like the different stores on iOS.</p>
<p>The updated software will be available in late October.</p>
