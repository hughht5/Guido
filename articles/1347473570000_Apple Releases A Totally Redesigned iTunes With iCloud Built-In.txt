<p>As with every new hardware releases, Apple updated iTunes. But the media software received a major update today. The interface is now totally new with an edge-to-edge design. Browsing your music feels completely different with a great emphasis on album art. The left-side column is gone and it seems like the new iTunes is all about music.</p>
<p>You can switch back to a more traditional interface with listings of your music available and browse by artist. The interface is much clearer with pop-up elements that look like iOS. Search was improved. The mini-player was redesigned.</p>
<p>You can now search directly from the mini-player and even manage playlists.</p>
