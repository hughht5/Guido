<p>The HQ consists of 11 buildings in the South Lake Union area, comprising a total of 1.8 million square feet of corporate office space. Amazon is buying the property from Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen&#8217;s investment firm, Vulcan Real Estate, which put the buildings up for sale at the end of August.</p>
<p>Reuters notes that, based on the value of the deal, Amazon is paying the highest ever price for an office building of 100,000+ square feet in Seattle &#8212; shelling out around $644 per square foot, which is more than double the average rate of $308 for Seattle office space, according to real-estate analyst house Real Capital Analytics.</p>
<p>Owning its own HQ will presumably enable Amazon to ensure there are even fewer loose lips around the place &#8212; by doing away with things like landlord inspections. You might not think the odd visit from the building&#8217;s owners or their staff is a big deal but this is the company that puts up <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/24/loose-lips-sink-kindles/">propaganda posters</a> warning staff of the dangers of tech bloggers eavesdropping on their chit-chat.</p>
<p>Amazon began moving staff to the South Lake Union area in 2010, <a target="_blank" href="http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2015071695_emptyamazon117.html">vacating properties in downtown Seattle</a> and giving up its former HQ in the PacMed Center last year as it sought roomier premises to accommodate its increasing headcount.</p>
