The report cites &#8220;a person with knowledge of the planning&#8221; of the event as the source, but doesn&#8217;t go into further detail about how specifically they&#8217;ll be promoting it from an educational perspective. But if Apple&#8217;s introducing a lower-cost iPad mini as expected, the benefits in terms of institutional purchases are obvious.</p>
<p>At a <a title="Analyst Puts iPad Mini Build Cost At $195, Pricing Said To Start At $329 For 40% Gross Margin" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/21/analyst-puts-ipad-mini-build-cost-at-195-pricing-said-to-start-at-329-for-40-gross-margin/">reported starting price of around $329</a>, the iPad mini would be a full $170 cheaper than the latest iPad, and $70 cheaper than the current selling price of the iPad 2. That&#8217;s bound to attract interest from educators, given that iPads are already being adopted by many school districts in the U.S., both in pilot programs and in full-scale deployment, as in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tuaw.com/2012/06/26/san-diego-school-district-purchases-26-000-ipads/">San Diego Unified School District</a>, which is deploying around 26,000 iPads to students this year.</p>
<p>Apple has also been pushing education initiatives on the software side in the past couple of years, with dedicated iTunes U applications for instructors, teachers and students, and an <a title="Apple Unveils New iBooks Author Tool, Not Just For Textbooks" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/19/apple-unveils-new-ibooks-author-tool-not-just-for-textbooks/">iBooks publisher</a> geared towards creating interactive, rich media-filled digital textbooks for educational use. That attention isn&#8217;t going unnoticed – back in August, IDC released a market share report regarding worldwide tablet shipments and noted that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/02/idc-apples-ipad-grew-q2-tablet-share-to-68-as-it-braces-for-windows-8-amazon-and-nexus-competition/">education in particular is a vertical where interest in Apple&#8217;s tablet is on the rise</a>.</p>
<p>Promoting the iPad as an educational tool will likely involve not only highlighting the device&#8217;s past and current success in this area, but also making a concerted, forward-looking sales pitch as well. Others have clearly noticed that the education market is a clear area for promoting tablet growth, like Amazon, which recently added to the existing appeal of its bargain-basement Kindle Fire pricing (a souped up version of last year&#8217;s model retails for $159) with a <a title="Amazon’s New Whispercast Service Provides Organization-Wide Kindle Content Deployment" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/17/amazons-new-whispercast-service-provides-organization-wide-kindle-content-deployment/">new free Whispercast mobile device management platform</a> that lets schools easily deploy updates and content to a whole fleet of Kindle hardware, with support for Kindle Fire Android software coming soon.</p>
<p>Apple has first-mover advantage, which is important with education markets, since the processes involved in making institution-wide IT procurement decisions can take quite a while to get rolling, and it&#8217;s hard to switch horses mid-race. But Amazon&#8217;s clearly playing hardball with education, which not only leads to higher device sales near-term, but also exposes whole new generations to a company&#8217;s devices early on in life. Education could be where the sparks really fly as Apple diversifies its tablet lineup, and it&#8217;ll be interesting to see how the company girds for that battle on stage at tomorrow&#8217;s event, should this report prove accurate.</p>
