<p>This will actually be Google&#8217;s first big marketing push for the Chromebook, he said. Pichai compared the situation to the launch of Chrome, where Google waited until the team felt it was &#8220;really ready for the mainstream,&#8221; which meant that the first real ad campaign ran about year after Chrome first became available.</p>
<p>You can see the first &#8220;For Everyone&#8221; ad below. It&#8217;s definitely aiming for a non-techie audience — there was no mention of specs or features, and in fact relatively few shots of the Chromebook itself (there was a fleeting glimpse of a toddler stepping on one). Instead, it consists mostly of what looked like home video footage, emphasizing the idea that Chromebooks should be used by everyone as a part of their daily lives.</p>
<p>The company will also be expanding its brick-and-mortar retail efforts. Back Google I/O in June, Google announced that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/28/chromebooks-to-arrive-in-100-best-buy-stores-across-u-s-more-retailers-coming-soon/">Chromebooks would be sold in 100 Best Buy stores</a>. Today Pichai said that&#8217;s expanding to 500 stores, which will have special Chromebook kiosks staffed by Google-trained specialists.</p>
<p>The new Chromebook will also be available for order online as well, of course, including in the Google Play store. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/">Go here read more about the device</a> and find pre-order links.</p>
