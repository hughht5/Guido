To kick off <a target="_blank" href="http://www.collegeknowledgechallenge.org/">College Knowledge Challenge</a> the submission period, it&#8217;s co-hosting an edtech hackathon today at Facebook&#8217;s headquarters at 1 Hacker Way in Menlo Park.</p>
<p>Devs of all ages are tasked with creating apps that build pathways to college, build peer groups for in-coming college students, and assist with college admission and getting financial aid. So if you want kids to be smarter, build them something and earn one of the $100,000 prizes.</p>
<p>Stacey Childress, Deputy Director of Education for the Gates Foundation, introduced the event saying: &#8221;At the Gates foundation we&#8217;re increasingly focused on personalized learning. We mean meeting every student where they are every day so they get what they need next to be successful. Tech isn&#8217;t a solution to that but it&#8217;s part of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>As to why the College Knowledge Challenge is asking developers to build Facebook apps in particular, she noted &#8220;Social networking sites&#8230;are emerging as critical to students, and low-income students especially to build social capital outside the boundaries of their neighborhoods. Facebook&#8230;contributes not only to academic success but their persistence. They feel more connected and are more lily to stay in school.&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>While the apps are designed for low-income and first-generation college students, they don&#8217;t have to be built by them. Deborah Robinson from the Gates Foundation tells me &#8221;We need to break down the barriers and have anyone with a good idea bring it.&#8221;</p>
<p>$18,000 in hackathon prizes will be awarded later today, with the 30 best College Knowledge Challenge apps that unlock higher ed named after submissions close on November 16th. Developers can <a target="_blank" href="http://www.collegeknowledgechallenge.org/">apply here</a>.</p>
<p><em>The event is just kicking off at Facebook HQ and we&#8217;ll have updates through the day plus an announcement of the hackathon winners tonight.</em></p>
