To kick off <a target="_blank" href="http://www.collegeknowledgechallenge.org/">College Knowledge Challenge</a> the submission period, it&#8217;s co-hosting an edtech hackathon today at Facebook&#8217;s headquarters at 1 Hacker Way in Menlo Park.</p>
<p>Devs of all ages are tasked with creating apps that build pathways to college, build peer groups for in-coming college students, and assist with college admission and getting financial aid. So if you want kids to be smarter, build them something and earn some cash.</p>
<p></p>
<p>$18,000 in hackathon prizes will be awarded later today, with the best College Knowledge Challenge apps that unlock higher ed named after submissions close on November 16th.</p>
<p>While the apps are designed for students, they don&#8217;t have to be built by them. Deborah Robinson from the Gates Foundation tells me &#8221;We need to break down the barriers and have anyone with a good idea bring it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The event is just kicking off at Facebook HQ and we&#8217;ll have updates through the day plus an announcement of the hackathon winners tonight.</p>
