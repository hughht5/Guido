It&#8217;s called <a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/badabing!/id548536602?mt=8&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+hnycombinator+%28HN+-+hnycombinator%29">Badabing!</a> and it basically goes through your friends&#8217; photos on Facebook to pull out the ones of them at the pool or beach. In other words, we&#8217;re talking about scantily clad photos here.</p>
<p>I of course, for the sake of technology journalism, had to download the app and give it a whirl. It actually kind of works and it&#8217;s really creepy. To protect the <del datetime="2012-10-28T22:24:02+00:00">not so</del> innocent, I&#8217;m not going to post any actual screenshots of my Facebook friends. They&#8217;d kill me. And probably the folks who made this app.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/badabing!/id548536602?mt=8&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+hnycombinator+%28HN+-+hnycombinator%29">app is $1.99</a> and all you have to do is log in with your Facebook account and then choose a few friends to dig up some dirt on. The company has some sort of image recognition technology that looks for&#8230;skin? </p>

<p>After your search is complete you can bookmark your favorite photos. Now let&#8217;s get to the heart of the matter, is this wrong to do? I mean, technically, your friends have uploaded these photos and shared them with you anyway. All this app does is do a search, albeit a search with <del datetime="2012-10-28T22:29:11+00:00">slightly</del> icky intent.</p>
<p>Moral of the story, don&#8217;t upload photos to Facebook and share them with friends unless you want them looking at them. Especially if you&#8217;re in a bikini or tight swim trunks.</p>
<p>Creep you out? Cool use of tech? Tell us in the comments.</p>
