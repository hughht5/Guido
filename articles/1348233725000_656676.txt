The <a target="_blank" href="http://dataprotection.ie/">DPC</a>, whose decisions had wider-ranging implications for all of Facebook&#8217;s business in Europe, had made several recommendations earlier in the year to bring Facebook&#8217;s policies in line with that of data protection regulations in the region. And it has now officially announced that &#8220;the great majority of the recommendations have been fully implemented to the satisfaction of this Office.&#8221; Key to Facebook&#8217;s success is that it is turning off its facial recognition features, also known as &#8220;Tag Suggest&#8221;: This feature has already been turned off for new users in the EU, the DPC notes, &#8220;and templates for existing users will be deleted by 15 October.&#8221;</p>
<p>The full report is <a target="_blank" href="http://dataprotection.ie/docs/Facebook_Audit_Review_Report/1232.htm">here</a> and also embedded below.</p>
<p>Facebook had been the subject of a months-long investigation into its practices after complaints <a target="_blank" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/07/the-austrian-thorn-in-facebooks-side/">raised in 2011</a> by a user group in Austria. The case has been handled in Ireland because this is the location of its international headquarters, and has been through a few turns already where the DPC has <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/21/privacy-changes-audit/">laid out terms</a>, and Facebook has <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/03/facebook-missed-irish-data-protection-deadline-says-consumer-group-facebook-objects/">responded</a>, more <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/11/facebook-privacy-policy-changes/">than once</a>.</p>
<p>The DPC says today&#8217;s report is the result of evaluations it made through the first half of 2012 and on-site at Facebook&#8217;s HQ in Dublin over the course of two days in May and four in July.</p>
<p>The areas where the DPC says FB has made improvements are in the areas of better transparency for the user in how their data  is handled; user control over settings; more clarity on the retention periods for the deletion of  personal data, and users getting more control over deleting things; an improvement in how users can access their personal data; and the ability of Facebook to be able to better track how they are complying with data protection requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Irish Data Protection Commissioner, Billy Hawkes said, “I am satisfied that the Review has demonstrated a clear and ongoing commitment on the part of FB-I to comply with its data protection responsibilities by way of implementation or progress towards implementation of the recommendations in the Audit Report. I am particularly encouraged in relation to the approach it has decided to adopt on the tag suggest/facial recognition feature by in fact agreeing to go beyond our initial recommendations, in light of developments since then, in order to achieve best practice. This feature has already been turned off for new users in the EU and templates for existing users will be deleted by 15 October, pending agreement with my Office on the most appropriate means of collecting user consent. By doing so it is sending a clear signal of its wish to demonstrate its commitment to best practice in data protection compliance.”<br />
Deputy Commissioner, Gary Davis who led the both the Audit and the Review stated that “the outcome reflects months of detailed engagement between Facebook Ireland and this Office. The discussions and negotiations that have taken place, while often robust on both sides, were at all times constructive with a collective goal of compliance with data protection requirements. There were a number of items on which progress was not as fully forward as we had hoped and we have set a deadline of 4 weeks for these matters to be brought to a satisfactory conclusion.<br />
It is also clear that ongoing engagement with the company will be necessary as it continues to bring forward new ways of serving advertising to users and retaining users on the site. The value of such engagement to identify and deal with any data protection concerns prior to launch of new products and services is fully accepted by FB-I.”<br />
