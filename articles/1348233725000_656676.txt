The <a target="_blank" href="http://dataprotection.ie/">DPC</a>, whose decisions had wider-ranging implications for all of Facebook&#8217;s business in Europe, had made several recommendations earlier in the year to bring Facebook&#8217;s policies in line with that of data protection regulations in the region. And it has now officially announced that &#8220;the great majority of the recommendations have been fully implemented to the satisfaction of this Office.&#8221; Key to Facebook&#8217;s success is that it is turning off its facial recognition features, also known as &#8220;Tag Suggest&#8221;: This feature has already been turned off for new users in the EU, the DPC notes, &#8220;and templates for existing users will be deleted by 15 October.&#8221;</p>
