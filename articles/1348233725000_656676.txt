The <a target="_blank" href="http://dataprotection.ie/">DPC</a>, whose decisions had wider-ranging implications for all of Facebook&#8217;s business in Europe, had made several recommendations earlier in the year to bring Facebook&#8217;s policies in line with that of data protection regulations in the region. And it has now officially announced that &#8220;the great majority of the recommendations have been fully implemented to the satisfaction of this Office.&#8221; Key to Facebook&#8217;s success is that it is turning off its facial recognition features, also known as &#8220;Tag Suggest&#8221;: This feature has already been turned off for new users in the EU, the DPC notes, &#8220;and templates for existing users will be deleted by 15 October.&#8221;</p>
<p>The full report is <a target="_blank" href="http://dataprotection.ie/docs/Facebook_Audit_Review_Report/1232.htm">here</a> and also embedded below.</p>
<p>Facebook had been the subject of a months-long investigation into its practices after complaints <a target="_blank" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/07/the-austrian-thorn-in-facebooks-side/">raised in 2011</a> by a user group in Austria. The case has been handled in Ireland because this is the location of its international headquarters, and has been through a few turns already where the DPC has <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/21/privacy-changes-audit/">laid out terms</a>, and Facebook has <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/03/facebook-missed-irish-data-protection-deadline-says-consumer-group-facebook-objects/">responded</a>, more <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/11/facebook-privacy-policy-changes/">than once</a>.</p>
<p>The DPC says today&#8217;s report is the result of evaluations it made through the first half of 2012 and on-site at Facebook&#8217;s HQ in Dublin over the course of two days in May and four in July.</p>
<p>The areas where the DPC says FB has made improvements are in the areas of better transparency for the user in how their data  is handled; user control over settings; more clarity on the retention periods for the deletion of  personal data, and users getting more control over deleting things; an improvement in how users can access their personal data; and the ability of Facebook to be able to better track how they are complying with data protection requirements.</p>
<p>More to come.</p>
