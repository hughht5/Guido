Today it&#8217;s expanded the international reach of the platform by adding Japan to the list of supported countries &#8212; describing this as &#8220;another significant addition&#8221;. A Japanese appstore launch is planned &#8220;later this year&#8221;.</p>
<p>Developers building apps for Amazon&#8217;s mobile products, such as its Kindle Fire and Fire HD tablets, can now submit apps to the ecommerce giant&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.amazon.com/welcome.html?login=https://developer.amazon.com/ap_login/68747470733A2F2F646576656C6F7065722E616D617A6F6E2E636F6D2F686F6D652E68746D6C.html">Mobile App Distribution Portal</a> for distribution in Japan. The portal enables developers the ability to select the countries where they would like their apps to be sold, set list prices per market and access various resources provided by Amazon. Amazon said it is waiving all first year fees for new developers.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s more on the services it offers via the Portal from Amazon&#8217;s Mobile App Distribution Portal blog</p>
<blockquote><p>By customizing your apps for different countries you can ensure customers have an easier time discovering and using your apps, In-App Purchase items, and subscriptions.  You can learn more about <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazonappstoredev.com/2012/07/international-localization.html">Android localization tips and resources</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazonappstoredev.com/2012/07/localizing-apps-within-the-amazon-mobile-app-distribution-portal.html">steps for localizing your app in the Distribution Portal</a> right here on the blog, or learn more about international app distribution on the <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.amazon.com/welcome.html">Mobile App Distribution Portal</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Opening our portal to app and game developers looking to reach Japanese customers is an important milestone as we strive to serve consumers and developers globally,&#8221; says Jim Adkins, Vice President of the Amazon Appstore, in a statement. &#8220;Many of our existing developers are anxious to localize their apps and games for Japanese consumers, and we look forward to working with new developers that have been waiting for a chance to bring their Japanese content to the Amazon platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By continuing to expand our app program internationally, as well as build upon the app services offered by Amazon, we are giving developers the opportunity to attract more customers and expand their businesses,&#8221; he added.</p>
