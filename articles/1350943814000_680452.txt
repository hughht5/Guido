<p>In particular, Mayer utilized the first few minutes of the call to explain with enthusiasm why she&#8217;s focused so much of her energy during her first 100 days as CEO on initiatives such as hiring new executives and bolstering Yahoo&#8217;s internal company culture. The human element is central to bringing Yahoo back to its one-time spot as a top consumer Internet company, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;My goals are simple: To execute faster, hire top talent, and make Yahoo the absolute best place to work,&#8221; she said. </p>
<p>Though flashy Mayer-led initiatives such as buying <a target="_blank" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/marissa-mayer-just-gave-every-yahoo-employee-an-iphone-5-2012-9">new iPhones for all employees</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://allthingsd.com/20120729/in-week-two-marissa-mayer-googifies-yahoo-free-food-friday-afternoon-all-hands-new-work-spaces-fab-swag/">company-wide free lunch</a> have gotten a lot of press, she was quick to point out that attracting and retaining top talent is not all about spending money. &#8220;True cultural change can&#8217;t be bought, so the vast majority of what we&#8217;ve done hasn&#8217;t cost anything.&#8221; </p>
<p>Mayer said that along with perks like phones and food, she has focused on improving employees&#8217; &#8220;efficiency, well-being, and accountability&#8221; through things like new feedback tools, reduced corporate bureacracy, and more specific performance measurement and goal metrics.</p>
<h4>Building the executive suite &#8216;Dream Team&#8217;</h4>
<p>She also touted her many new executive suite hires such as<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/27/kathy-savitt-named-yahoo-cmo/"> CMO Kathy Savitt</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/yahoo-names-ken-goldman-chief-204800980.html">CFO Ken Goldman</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/16/yahoo-ceo-marissa-mayer-fills-coo-role-with-former-google-colleague-henrique-de-castro/">COO Henrique de Castro</a>, and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/05/yahoo-ceo-marissa-mayers-newest-hire-jacqueline-reses-evp-of-hr-and-talent-acquisition/">EVP of HR and talent Jacqueline Reses</a>. </p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve built a stellar world-class leadership team,&#8221; she said, adding later, &#8220;In Yahoo Fantasy Sports, I would draft this exact group as my dream team.&#8221; But later in the call she acknowledged that in many ways, the hard work is just beginning right now. &#8220;With the leadership and guidance of our new management team, now it&#8217;s time to execute.&#8221;</p>
<h4>Bringing focus to Yahoo&#8217;s &#8216;splintered&#8217; mobile presence</h4>
<p>Beyond the human element, Mayer also said she believes a big factor in Yahoo&#8217;s turnaround will be restoring a sense of focus to the company&#8217;s products. Mobile, especially, is a department that needs cohesion. She said that the fact that Yahoo operates a whopping 76 apps across Android and iOS is evidence of a &#8220;splintered&#8221; mobile brand presence that needs to be brought together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our top priority is a focused, coherent mobile strategy,&#8221; she said. She added later in the call that this is a big issue since &#8220;at some point [in the near future] we&#8217;ll have to be a predominantly mobile company,&#8221; meaning that at least half of Yahoo&#8217;s staff will need strong mobile skills. This will be developed through hiring new people and training existing staff, she said.</p>
<h4>No &#8216;giant pivot&#8217; necessary</h4>
<p>With all the big changes, however, Mayer was quick to clarify that she sees the keys to Yahoo&#8217;s success as being already within the company&#8217;s DNA. </p>
<p>&#8220;My view is that the core of Yahoo is incredibly valuable and a great platform to build on. I don&#8217;t think this is a situation where there is a giant pivot and we go into a completely different business,&#8221; she said, noting that Yahoo already strong operations in what she sees as its four key areas: Search, mail, homepage, and mobile. &#8220;The future of Yahoo is extraordinarily bright&#8230; we&#8217;re committed to going back to our roots as a consumer Internet company focused on user experience.&#8221;</p>
