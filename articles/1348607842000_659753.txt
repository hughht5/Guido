The update now ensures that you&#8217;ll be able to check out your photos using the iPhone 5&#8242;s full 4-inches of glory.</p>
<p>Use of the larger screen doesn&#8217;t bring any major interface changes to the table: you&#8217;ll just see more of your feed at once. Would&#8217;ve been nice to see some additional use of the extra space, but at least the app, which is all about a pleasant viewing experience, isn&#8217;t letterboxed anymore. You&#8217;ll also get a new onboarding process for new users, useful if you&#8217;re just picking it up for the first time, as well as better password recovery options. It&#8217;s available now as a free update from the App Store.</p>
