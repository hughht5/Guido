That&#8217;s according to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.localytics.com/blog/2012/samsung-benefiting-from-iphone-comparisons/">new info from analytics firm Localytics</a>, which says that Samsung sees a GSIII sales spike whenever it gets compared with Apple&#8217;s phone.</p>
<p>There was a huge spike in GSIII sales when <a title="Apple Now Owed Only $1.049 Billion In Damages After Jury Revisits Inconsistent Verdict" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/24/hang-on-a-minute-jurors-awarded-apple-damages-without-finding-infringements/">Apple won its case against Samsung in the U.S. over patent infringement</a> and was awarded $1 billion in damages and there was another when the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/apple-announcement-roundup-iphone-5-new-ipod-touch-ipod-nano-earpods/">iPhone 5 was announced</a> and the Internet lit up with comparison charts and articles. Device growth for Samsung&#8217;s handset slowed before and following both of these events.</p>
<p>Locatytics thinks this might be the start of general ambivalence among consumers when it comes to mobile OS choice. Comments on our articles suggest otherwise, but of course we&#8217;re speaking to a highly engaged, technical audience in a lot of cases.</p>
<p>OS agnosticism could indeed be a growing trend among smartphone consumers, who are comparing devices on other measures instead, but there&#8217;s also the old saying that any press is good press. Samsung&#8217;s name being out there more often in articles is good for the brand, especially when it&#8217;s being used as a measure for a brand with the reputation of Apple. That&#8217;s a far cry from a few years ago, when virtually every other hardware manufacturer was lumped into a general category of potential &#8220;iPhone killers,&#8221; most of which stood no chance of really standing up.</p>
