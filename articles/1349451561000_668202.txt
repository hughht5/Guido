The Visual Energy Monostrip is one of the first power strips &#8211; more an outlet, really &#8211; with a built-in server that allows you to configure, control, and monitor the amount of juice going into various appliances.</p>
<p>The product isn&#8217;t visually arresting &#8211; the company also makes the UFO, which looks far cooler &#8211; but the functionality is what&#8217;s important. With the built-in server and Wi-Fi you can turn the light on and off remotely and schedule it to go on and off at certain times. You can also see how much you&#8217;re paying to power the socket.</p>

<p>The system is fairly simple right now. To set it up you plug in the outlet and look for a new Wi-Fi access point. Once you connect, you can assign the outlet to connect to the Internet via your in-home Wi-Fi. Then, using a mobile app, you can register the outlet and control it from your phone. I love being able to press one button from the dining room and watching the light go on in the living room.</p>
<p>I think the most important aspect is the remote management of power. By installing, say a few of these in the house you can turn off lights and appliances from almost anywhere, allowing for very specific control of your energy patterns. I&#8217;d love to see this nascent product grow &#8211; and I&#8217;m sure the functionality will be replicated in other products down the line.</p>
<p>Visual Energy is a Palo Alto company led by Marco Graziano, an expert in Internet appliances. He was amazed that when he plugged the device into his home TV setup he was drawing about $5 worth of electricity a month. His goal is to help others make good decisions about how to use and, in turn, conserve energy.</p>
