I&#8217;d never run a TechCrunch Meetup or &#8216;CrunchUp&#8217; in Italy, so I asked my contacts there, where and when should we do one? Little did I realise the tsunami I&#8217;d unleash. It seems the tech scene in Italy has been growing fast recently. I don&#8217;t know all the reasons why just yet (we&#8217;ll leave the economists to speculate perhaps), but a simple CrunchUp planned for Rome this week has since become <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/12/techcrunch-italy-an-event-to-showcase-italian-startups-globally/">TechCrunch Italy</a>. So, ok, we&#8217;ll just go with that. My friends at <a target="_blank" href="http://Populis.com">Populis</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mindthebridge.org/">Mind The Bridge Foundation</a> have put together a great event this Thursday. We have some great <a target="_blank" href="http://www.techcrunch-italy.com/speaker/">speakers</a>, a great <a target="_blank" href="http://www.techcrunch-italy.com/agenda/">agenda</a>, a startup <a target="_blank" href="http://www.techcrunch-italy.com/startup/">showcase</a>, an amazing <a target="_blank" href="http://www.techcrunch-italy.com/venue/">venue</a> (modelled on Shakespeare&#8217;s Globe Theatre) and some great <a target="_blank" href="http://www.techcrunch-italy.com/sponsors/">sponsors</a>. We will be showcasing the best of the best Italian startups during the event and there&#8217;ll even be a hackathon organised by <a target="_blank" href="http://hackitaly.org/">Hackitaly</a> with 100 hackers.</p>
