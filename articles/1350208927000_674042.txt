<p>Saturday Night Live’s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/tech-talk-iphone-5/1420759">latest parody sketch</a> gives life to that oft-quted phrase &#8216;first world problems&#8217;. (Here&#8217;s an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6t-TBDJWmg">alternative link</a> if the one above doesn&#8217;t work). In a biting take-down of some of the legitimate, but sometimes whiny niggles us tech press have with the new iPhone 5, the show assembled a mock Tech TV show called Tech Talk. Chaired by Christina Applegate, it features &#8216;writers&#8217; from Cnet, Wired and Gizmodo who initially complain about Maps, a purplish hue in photos of the sun, and the unbearable lightness of the iPhone. These problems are variously described as a &#8216;nightmare&#8217;, &#8216;unacceptable&#8217; and &#8216;impossible&#8217; to deal with.</p>
<p>To put these problems in perspective three Chinese factory workers who made the iPhone are lined up to put these &#8216;problems&#8217; into perspective. &#8220;You wanted Starbucks, but it took you to Dunkin’ Donuts?” says one worker, &#8220;That must be so hard for you&#8230; I guess we are lucky that we don’t use Maps since we SLEEP where we work,” says one. Ouch, this is going to hurt.</p>
<p>It turns out the workers have a few &#8216;bugs&#8217; with the iPhone too &#8211; mainly the lice in their beds in the factory.</p>
<p>No amount of back-pedalling or apologizing gets the tech commentators out of the situation, including the workers bringing out a Chinese violin to accompany the whining.</p>
<p>Applegate asks the workers if they&#8217;d, in turn, like to complain about any American products &#8211; we won&#8217;t spoil the answer for you, but it&#8217;s a doozy.</p>
<p>Suffice to say, it&#8217;s sketch worth catching.</p>
