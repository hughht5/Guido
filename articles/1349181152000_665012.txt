Apple&#8217;s iPhone and iPad both offer only limited connectivity in the EU, where spectrum differences and, in some cases, an absence of 4G networks altogether, force the LTE-capable devices to use 3G connections.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where countries don&#8217;t make enough spectrum available, quite simply their citizens can&#8217;t enjoy 4G connections on the latest gadgets,&#8221; Ms. Kroes said, according to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.4-traders.com/APPLE-INC-4849/news/Apple-Inc-EU-Digital-Commissioner-Need-Effective-4G-or-Smartphone-Companies-May-Ignore-Europe-15247901/">Dow Jones news service</a>. &#8220;Without faster 4G roll-out, device makers won&#8217;t take Europe into account when planning their latest smartphones.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kroes, who has been a <a target="_blank" href="http://news.techworld.com/mobile-wireless/3379024/eu-commissioner-warns-member-states-to-back-broadband-next-gen-networks/">vocal supporter of expanding Europe&#8217;s next-generation broadband networks</a> in the past, indicated that not only more 4G networks are important, but also those working on the right radio spectrum to ensure device compatibility. That&#8217;s something EU member countries seem at least in part eager to make happen, according to our own Natasha Lomas&#8217; report on the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/20/iphone-5-how-apples-lte-band-choices-are-affecting-the-carrier-landscape-in-europe/">European LTE landscape following the iPhone 5&#8242;s</a><a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/screen-shot-2012-10-02-at-8-30-01-am.png"><br />
</a><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/20/iphone-5-how-apples-lte-band-choices-are-affecting-the-carrier-landscape-in-europe/"> release</a>. This morning, the BBC also reports that the U.K. might be pushing for a faster 4G rollout.</p>
<p>The plan Kroes espouses is to take around $64.27 billion out of the EU budget, and use that to invest in projects to expand 4G spectrum reach and availability. Kroes emphasizes that this isn&#8217;t a handout, it&#8217;s a loan and an investment on the EU&#8217;s part designed to be paid back with interest. The plan isn&#8217;t popular with everyone; some countries want to go it alone rather than taking money out of EU coffers to fund a widespread approach.</p>
<p>Whatever route EU states end up taking, one things is clear: The iPhone 5 and latest iPad are adding a sense of urgency to Europe&#8217;s plans to expand 4G availability.</p>
