The response has three parts: A motion to strike portions of EA&#8217;s suit, an &#8220;answer and demand for jury trial&#8221; on other portions of the suit, and a counterclaim from Zynga.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll update this post with summaries and full copies of Zynga&#8217;s response. Here&#8217;s the company&#8217;s initial statement statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today we responded to EAâ€™s claims which we believe have no merit. We also filed a counterclaim which addresses actions by EA we believe to be anticompetitive and unlawful business practices, including legal threats and demands for no-hire agreements. We look forward to getting back to focusing all our efforts on delighting our players.</p></blockquote>
