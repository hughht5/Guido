California, the newest state to ease the inconvenience of voter registration, <a target="_blank" href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/california-politics/2012/09/california-launches-online-voter-registration-system.html">launched their</a> online portal today. &#8220;Today, the Internet replaces the mailbox for thousands of Californians wishing to register to vote,&#8221; California Secretary of State Debra Bowen said. &#8220;Today we are taking the next step in the never-ending evolution of democracy and reaching every Californian.&#8221;</p>
<p>Voters have been able to register online for years but had to complete the process with a partially filled-out registration form that was mailed to users. Unfortunately, studies have shown that netizens didn&#8217;t take the extra step and such hybrid <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/28/google-online-voter-registration-could-decrease-turnout/">online-offline efforts could actually decrease voter registration</a>.</p>
<p>Among the more innovative uses of online voter registration was developed by the state of Washington. Voters there can <a target="_blank" href="http://www.csmonitor.com/Innovation/2012/0718/Register-to-vote-through-Facebook-Washington-reveals-new-app">register through Facebook</a> with an app that populates the regular online form with data gleaned from a user&#8217;s Facebook account. Another effort, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ourtime.org/">Ourtime</a>, a voter initiative organization, has teamed up with websites, such as Lady Gaga&#8217;s, Yahoo, and (Aol-owned) <em>The Huffington Post</em>, to embed links to voter registration for citizens of states permitting online registration.</p>
<p>California, Arizona, Colorado, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Nevada, Maryland, and New York allow online registering, and Connecticut, Delaware, and Hawaii are on the path, according to Jarrett Moreno of Ourtime.</p>
<p>So Silicon Valley nerds, if you haven&#8217;t registered to vote, what are you waiting for? I just registered online, and, I gotta tell ya, it feels better than being massaged by angels at Disneyland. Go to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/elections_vr.htm">California Secretary of States website</a> and register now.</p>
