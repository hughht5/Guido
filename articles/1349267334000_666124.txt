T-Mobile previously sought to be acquired by AT&amp;T, but that deal was shot down by U.S. regulators.</p>
<p>The news that this deal was being discussed yesterday increased the value of MetroPCS shares by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-10-02/deutsche-telekom-said-to-near-deal-with-metropcs-in-u-dot-s-dot">as much as 26 percent</a>, putting its value at the highest in 14 months. The deal could help T-Mobile recover from losses to its subscriber base suffered by not being able to offer the iPhone on its network. The structure of the deal will reportedly operate as a reverse merger, with MetroPCS gobbling up the larger T-Mobile.</p>
<p>According to the WSJ, Deutsche Telekom will gradually reduce its ownership of the combined company over time, in a staged departure from the U.S. market, which is growing at a slower pace than others around the globe in the wireless sector. Deutsche Telekom will retain about 75% of the new company initially, and will also retain $15 billion of the total debt owned by the new entity, while MetroPCS shareholders will get a payout of $4 per share or about $1.5 billion in total, the report claims.</p>
