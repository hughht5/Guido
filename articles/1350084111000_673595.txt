Sometimes it&#8217;s a Facebook ad, a video or something using the service itself, <a target="_blank" href="http://thenextweb.com/dd/2012/04/30/witness-the-coolest-job-resume-youll-ever-see-on-the-web/">like a slideshow</a>.</p>
<p>In the case of Ryan Lessard, he really wants to work for social reward company <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/01/kiip-is-the-perfect-company-to-show-off-the-potential-of-apple-passbook-heres-what-it-looks-like/">Kiip</a>. He&#8217;s gone all out by posting a link to this site on AdWords that display for a Google search of &#8220;Kiip.&#8221; Genius. But what&#8217;s more genius is <a target="_blank" href="http://whyiwouldkickassatkiip.com/">the site he created</a> (WhyIWouldKickAssAtKiip.com), check it out:</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/12/this-guy-really-wants-to-work-for-social-reward-platform-kiip-is-this-the-new-way-to-land-a-job/snapshot-101212-401-pm/" rel="attachment wp-att-673687"></a></p>
<p>Yes, this looks like a Kiip reward unit that pops up in a mobile app that uses the service&#8217;s SDK, complete with a video pitch. Amazing.</p>
<p>Is this the new way to land a job that you covet? This is becoming a trend and it&#8217;s only getting more intense and seriously targeted to the potential employers. I reached out to Kiip&#8217;s CEO Brian Wong for his thoughts on the maneuver by Ryan and here&#8217;s what he had to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s pretty awesome that someone can be this creative to catch our attention. Kiip is hiring and we&#8217;re always looking for great people. I think he raised the bar for everyone just a little bit.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s almost as if this type of thing skips the recruitment process completely, surfacing passionate people who care about the company itself. Will Ryan get the job? I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s being considered just like Kiip considers all candidates, but this surely got his foot in the door in a major way.</p>
