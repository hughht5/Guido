The folks at audio company <a target="_blank" href="http://createdigitalmusic.com/2012/09/iphone-5-audio-accessories-compatible-some-require-adapters-ik-line-6-official-word/">Line 6 did some &#8220;preliminary tests&#8221;</a> and found that:</p>
<div style="margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px;padding-left:15px;border-left:3px solid #ccc;font-style:italic;">Line 6 is still testing their accessories with iPhone 5, but founder Marcus Ryle tells CDM, “Based on what’s been announced, for audio products that operate using USB Host mode and follow Apple approved methods such as CoreAudio and CoreMIDI, I would not expect there to be any technical issue.” I asked if they had anything to say about future Lightning support, but Ryle responded, “We continue to be excited about providing music-making devices for iOS devices, but we can’t comment on what additional products might be upcoming.”</div>
<p>Note the weasel words here (&#8220;Based on what’s been announced&#8221;). While we&#8217;re still in Schrodinger&#8217;s Cat territory with the adapter and dock combo, it seems that a reputable company is standing by the position that the new adapter will work with standard audio devices. However, the jury is still clearly out.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.apple.com/technologies/ios/audio-and-video.html">Core Audio</a> is an Apple standard for playing sound on Macs and iPods/iPhones. Some docks may require special features that can&#8217;t be replicated through lightning, but the chances of that are slim. In the end, I guess we just have to wait and hope our devices survive the transition.</p>
