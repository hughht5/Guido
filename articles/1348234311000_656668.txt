According to early reviews, it&#8217;s a great device, but that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean it&#8217;s the right one for everybody. Even if you&#8217;re still a potential iPhone buyer, the lineup has never looked so good. The iPhone 4 and the 4S remain on the market, and they both have a lot to offer, too, at a considerable discount.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a handy guide to what you get with each device, created by TechCrunch. We&#8217;ve tried to distill it down to the most important factors, and when you combine this with our chart detailing <a title="iOS 6 Is Now Available: Here’s What Features Your iDevice Gets" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/19/ios-6-is-now-available-heres-what-features-your-idevice-gets/">what each model does and doesn&#8217;t get with the iOS 6 update</a>, you should have an easier time deciding which one to pick up.</p>

<p>With most of the software features and a form factor some might actually prefer, the iPhone 4S at $99 is a mighty fine-looking deal. It&#8217;ll be interesting to see, once carrier data and Apple&#8217;s own quarterly results come in, how popular that remains as a second tent pole in Apple&#8217;s overall lineup.</p>
<p>Of course, one other important factor to consider might be availability. The iPhone 5 will likely be scarce today, with lineups around the world sizeable at Apple Stores this morning, if you&#8217;ve got your heart set on the iPhone 5 it&#8217;s probably worth waiting for.</p>
