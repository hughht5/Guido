This year, the acceptance rate at four of the eight Ivy League Schools <a target="_blank" href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/03/30/pf/college/acceptance_rates_ivy_league/index.htm">hit record lows</a>. Stanford professors Daphne Koller and Andrew Ng launched <a target="_blank" href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> earlier this year to fling that door wide open. </p>
<p>They created a platform that provides the framework and hosting services for massively open online courses, or MOOCs, to bring, via the Web, an elite education to the public for free. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/18/coursera-raises-16m/">At launch</a>, when there were only three institutions on board, it almost seemed crazy. But universities see Coursera as an opportunity to experiment online learning and alternative teaching techniques. In the beginning, the Coursera team had to go out and actively seek partnerships with America&#8217;s elite institutions.</p>
<p>But as Coursera&#8217;s announcement made clear tonight, that is no longer the case. Institutions are signing up in droves and it may not be long before Coursera&#8217;s acceptance rate mimics Harvard&#8217;s. Seventeen new universities have joined the startup&#8217;s platform, nearly doubling the number of schools that have signed on. That means Coursera&#8217;s platform now hosts about 200 courses from 33 international and domestic schools and it now reaches over 1.3 million students around the world.</p>
