Thankfully, the company&#8217;s straight-laced follow-up &#8212; the nicely spec&#8217;d Optimus G &#8212; was revealed earlier this month, and now both <a target="_blank" href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/live-without-boundaries-with-the-all-new-lg-optimus-g-coming-from-att-and-sprint-172525321.html">AT&amp;T and Sprint</a> have signed on to sell the thing when it launches later this year.</p>
<p>Of course, just like nearly every phone announcement made this week, neither carrier has revealed when they plan to stock the G on their respective shelves. All LG will say is that the Optimus will see the light of day at some point in Q4, and that could mean a decent wait. Whether or not Verizon Wireless or T-Mobile (or should I say,<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/03/report-deutsche-telekom-and-metropcs-boards-give-go-ahead-to-t-mobile-merger/"> T-Metro</a>) will carry the thing is still up in the air too, but it wouldn&#8217;t be a shock to see the former pick up the G in time for the holidays.</p>
<p>The Optimus G, in case you&#8217;ve forgotten, sports a 4.7-inch HD (1280&#215;768, to be specific) IPS display, and pairs a 1.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro processor with an LTE radio &#8212; a combination that&#8217;s only starting to pick up steam here in the States. Nestled within the G&#8217;s surprisingly sturdy plastic frame is 2GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage to boot. Sprint actually seems to have gotten the better part of the deal when it comes to snapping photos.</p>
<p>You see, Sprint&#8217;s version of Optimus G packs a 13-megapixel camera instead of the 8-megapixel shooter that AT&amp;T&#8217;s variant does. Then again, the company&#8217;s LTE network still currently covers only a fraction of what AT&amp;T&#8217;s does, so in the end both carrier&#8217;s consumers have something to get riled up over. To make things even dicier, there could be more Optimus-oriented squabbling in the works very shortly if some recent rumblings hold true &#8212; some claim that Google&#8217;s <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/01/rumor-roundup-googles-new-nexus-phone-is-said-to-launch-this-month-but-which-one-is-it/">next Nexus smartphone</a> will be based on the Optimus G hardware, which could make those holiday purchasing choices even tougher to hash out.</p>
