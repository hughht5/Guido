Just ahead of the holiday shopping season, Google is now <a target="_blank" href="http://googlecommerce.blogspot.com/2012/10/browse-your-favorite-catalogs-on-web.html">also making this service available on the web</a>. Google Catalogs on the web will feature brochures from about 300 brands, including the likes of Williams-Sonoma, J.Crew, Eddie Bauer, and Bose. From within the catalogs, shoppers can click on featured items to get more information and, of course, buy them from the retailers&#8217; own sites.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re hoping to browse the latest electronics catalogs, though, you will likely be disappointed by Google Catalog&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/catalogs/categories#section-Electronics &amp; Computers">selection</a>. The focus here is clearly on mainstream consumers. The featured catalogs currently include <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/catalogs/i?source=ps-home-banner&amp;id=6511581_0cfbef3b_5af8ba19">Fossil</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/catalogs/i?source=ps-home-banner&amp;id=2890713_e7b2a982_29509056">Crate &amp; Barrel</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/catalogs/i?source=ps-home-banner&amp;id=2890713_e7b2a982_29509056">HarthSong</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/catalogs/i?source=ps-home-banner&amp;id=8510920_073e9732_c389e7d0">The Wisconsin Cheeseman</a> (which apparently also lets you buy your cheese on a monthly installment plan).</p>
<p>Google says it plans to &#8220;incorporate catalogs more deeply throughout the Google Shopping experience, giving you more ways to find ideas and inspiration as you shop and engage with your favorite brands.&#8221;</p>
<p>This, of course, isn&#8217;t Google&#8217;s first foray into digitizing catalogs. All the way <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2011/08/17/google-catalogs-targets-the-couch-shopper/">back in 2001</a>, the company already offered a beta version of Google Catalogs that allows users to browse their PC Connection catalogs online. That service, however, was retired in 2009 (and had already been rather neglected before this). Google then resurrected the concept as a mobile app before last year&#8217;s holiday season.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Microsoft recently <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/24/microsoft-find-glimpse-catalogs/">unveiled</a> a similar project in cooperation with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.glimpse.com/catalogs">Glimpse Catalogs</a>.</p>
