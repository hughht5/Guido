The changes come amongst a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/apple-releases-a-totally-redesigned-itunes-with-icloud-built-in/">larger overhaul to the iTunes</a> store and player design.</p>
<p>Essentially, Apple has baked the most critical elements of Ping right into iTunes, namely music discovery and photos of your favorite artists. Meanwhile, Apple has stranded redundant features like Twitter and Facebook-esque artist following and  minimized the redundant &#8220;following&#8221; feature, and niche parts like concert listings in Ping, which could potentially disappear completely when the iTunes update rolls out in late October.</p>
<p>The idea of Ping being replaced by these new social features would mesh with a <a target="_blank" href="http://allthingsd.com/20120612/apples-ping-to-end-with-a-thud-in-next-release-of-itunes/">report from AllThingsD</a> from June indicating sources close to Apple say Ping will be removed when iTunes 11 launches.</p>
<p>Along with the new-found ability to share to Facebook from Siri, Apple&#8217;s other big Facebook integration previewed today was Like buttons and friends who&#8217;ve Liked shown on every single thing in iTunes. This gives Apple a lightweight way to take advantage of social recommendation &#8212; a powerful driver of purchases. When you see the names of friends who&#8217;ve bought something, you&#8217;re a lot more likely to buy too.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve purchased or downloaded something, you can share a link to that content to Facebook or Twitter.</p>
<p>In <a target="_blank" href="http://live.theverge.com/apple-iphone-5-live-blog/">the preview</a> of the integration, Apple showed that mobile app store entries will list the number of friends and a Facebook icon at the top. If users check out the Reviews tab, they&#8217;ll see the names of those friends and a Like button. This provides a much more simple and accessible alternative to finding or inviting friends to Ping and following them in order to see what they&#8217;re consuming.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Facebook and Twitter will gain content from those Like and share buttons, as they&#8217;ll make their feeds a better a way to discover cool music, video, and apps your friends are downloading. And those stories will generate referral clicks and installs from the friends of the original downloader. Hopefully the full-sized version of iTunes / App Store shows the faces of Facebook friends too, which would be much more eye-catching and persuasive.</p>
<p>The other chunk of Ping grafted right into iTunes is photo sharing from artists. Previously you&#8217;d have to follow your favorite artists on Ping and check your activity feed for their updates.</p>
<p><br />
Now Apple says that &#8220;We&#8217;ve given the artist the ability to share photos with you&#8221;, demonstrating how Coldplay was sharing photos right from their iTunes store page. So rather than just a big cover image, iTunes artists pages now offers a social presence in addition to a commerce.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll still have to wait until the late October iTunes 11 release date to see if Ping is just marginalized or actually scrapped entirely. This is just version 1 of a natively social iTunes, so Apple might keep Ping around a little longer.</p>
<p>Tim Cook may want to get serious about making artist pages into social feeds before deleting those feeds that now live in Ping. That way it could get artists to share exclusive content on their iTunes Pages, attracting to fans to where Apple can make money. Alternatively, it could cut its losses soon and focus attention social features that live in the iTunes store. Nobody was using Ping anyway, right? Its presence in the iTunes sidebar is just a sad reminder of one of Apple&#8217;s rare flops.</p>
