In particular, the Elastic Block Store part seems to be down. All services hosted on <a target="_blank" href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a>&#8216;s virtual private servers are still down at the time of writing. GitHub, imgur, Pocket, HipChat, Coursera and others are affected.</p>
<p>Reddit experienced hiccups as well but seems to be back to normal for most people. Reddit may use the same AWS instances as Heroku without using Heroku&#8217;s hosting solution.</p>
<p>Minecraft&#8217;s login system and website are down and Foursquare is experiencing difficulties.</p>
<p>Heroku currently <a target="_blank" href="https://status.heroku.com/#2012-10-22">reports</a> elevated error rates for both the production service and the development service.</p>
<p>Here is Amazon&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://status.aws.amazon.com/">AWS status page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>10:38 AM PDT We are currently investigating degraded performance for a small number of EBS volumes in a single Availability Zone in the US-EAST-1 Region.<br />
11:11 AM PDT We can confirm degraded performance for a small number of EBS volumes in a single Availability Zone in the US-EAST-1 Region. Instances using affected EBS volumes will also experience degraded performance.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many smaller services are reporting that they are affected by the outage.</p>
<p>Heroku was acquired by Salesforce back <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/08/breaking-salesforce-buys-heroku-for-212-million-in-cash/">in December 2010</a> for $212 million. It started out as a platform-as-a-service for Ruby applications. Many small developers can take advantage of Heroku to develop small web applications without dealing with server administration.</p>
