Major services, such as Reddit, Foursquare, Minecraft and Heroku, are down. GitHub, imgur, Pocket, HipChat, Coursera and others are affected.</p>
<p>Reddit experienced hiccups as well but seems to be back to normal for most people. (Update: it&#8217;s down again.) Reddit may use the same AWS instances as Heroku without using Heroku&#8217;s hosting solution.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> many other services are now down as the issue is now affecting other parts of AWS. Amazon&#8217;s RDS database instances and Elastic Beanstalk are now down in North Virginia. Minecraft&#8217;s login system and website are down, and Foursquare and Convo are experiencing difficulties. Finally, AWS&#8217;s ElastiCache and CloudWatch are experiencing delays and connectivity issues.</p>
<p>Heroku currently <a target="_blank" href="https://status.heroku.com/#2012-10-22">reports</a> elevated error rates for both the production service and the development service.</p>
<p>Here is Amazon&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://status.aws.amazon.com/">AWS status page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>10:38 AM PDT We are currently investigating degraded performance for a small number of EBS volumes in a single Availability Zone in the US-EAST-1 Region.<br />

11:26 AM PDT We are currently experiencing degraded performance for EBS volumes in a single Availability Zone in the US-EAST-1 Region. New launches for EBS backed instances are failing and instances using affected EBS volumes will experience degraded performance.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many smaller services are reporting that they are affected by the outage.</p>
<p>Heroku was acquired by Salesforce back <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/08/breaking-salesforce-buys-heroku-for-212-million-in-cash/">in December 2010</a> for $212 million. It started out as a platform-as-a-service for Ruby applications. Many small developers can take advantage of Heroku to develop small web applications without dealing with server administration.</p>
