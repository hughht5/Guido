Major services, such as Reddit, Foursquare, Minecraft and Heroku, are down. GitHub, imgur, Pocket, HipChat, Coursera and others are affected.</p>
<p>Reddit experienced hiccups at first when only the Elastic Bloc System was affected, but then seemed to go back to normal for most people. It is now down again.</p>
<p>Many other services are now down as the issue is now affecting other parts of Amazon Web Services. Amazon&#8217;s RDS database instances and Elastic Beanstalk are down in North Virginia. Minecraft, Pinterest, Foursquare and Airbnb are down. Finally, AWS&#8217;s ElastiCache and CloudWatch are experiencing delays and connectivity issues.</p>
<p>Heroku currently <a target="_blank" href="https://status.heroku.com/#2012-10-22">reports</a> elevated error rates for both the production service and the development service.</p>
<p>Many smaller services are reporting that they are affected by the outage. As always, users and developers are wondering why half of the Internet is going down <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/30/could-instagram-and-other-sites-avoid-going-down-with-amazons-ship/">every time</a> an AWS data center experiences issues.</p>
<p>On Amazon&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://status.aws.amazon.com/">AWS status page</a>, the company first reported issues only affecting EBS volumes:</p>
<blockquote><p>10:38 AM PDT We are currently investigating degraded performance for a small number of EBS volumes in a single Availability Zone in the US-EAST-1 Region.<br />
11:11 AM PDT We can confirm degraded performance for a small number of EBS volumes in a single Availability Zone in the US-EAST-1 Region. Instances using affected EBS volumes will also experience degraded performance.<br />
11:26 AM PDT We are currently experiencing degraded performance for EBS volumes in a single Availability Zone in the US-EAST-1 Region. New launches for EBS backed instances are failing and instances using affected EBS volumes will experience degraded performance.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then the Relational Database Service went down as well:</p>
<blockquote><p>11:03 AM PDT We are currently experiencing connectivity issues and degraded performance for a small number of RDS DB Instances in a single Availability Zone in the US-EAST-1 Region.<br />
11:45 AM PDT A number of Amazon RDS DB Instances in a single Availability Zone in the US-EAST-1 Region are experiencing connectivity issues or degraded performance. New instance create requests in the affected Availability Zone are experiencing elevated latencies. We are investigating the root cause.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Elastic Beanstalk experience similar issues:</p>
<blockquote><p>11:06 AM PDT We are currently experiencing elevated API failures and delays launching, updating and deleting Elastic Beanstalk environments in the US-East-1 Region.<br />
11:45 AM PDT We are continuing to see delays launching, updating and deleting Elastic Beanstalk environments in the US-East-1 Region.</p></blockquote>
