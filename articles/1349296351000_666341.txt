<p>But an organization called the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pipelinefellowship.com/home/">Pipeline Fellowship </a>is working to deliberately change that, by putting on angel investing &#8220;bootcamps&#8221; for women. Pipeline aims to &#8220;train&#8221; its participants to become angel investors through a combination of mentoring and practice.  As part of the experience,  each class of Pipeline Fellows together commit to pool their money and invest in a woman-led, for-profit venture of their choosing in exchange for equity and a board seat.</p>
<p>Pipeline founder <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=13426445&amp;authType=OUT_OF_NETWORK&amp;authToken=gCI2&amp;trk=hb_upphoto">Natalia Oberti Noguera</a> (pictured at left) told TechCrunch <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/01/making-angels-pipeline-fund-2011-fellows/">in an interview last year</a> that Pipeline&#8217;s aim is to take down what she perceives as bias against women in the VC world and the startup ecosystem at large.</p>
<p>Pipeline launched its program <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/01/making-angels-pipeline-fund-2011-fellows/">last year in New York</a>, and has since also had runs in Boston and Washington D.C. But this week it is making its first steps out west, announcing its first-ever Bay Area Fellowship Class. The program will kick off on Friday in San Francisco with the <a target="_blank" href="http://2012bayareapipelinefellowshipconference.eventbrite.com">Bay Area Pipeline Fellowship Conference</a>.</p>
