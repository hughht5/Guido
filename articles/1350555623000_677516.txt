The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/media/judgments/2012/samsung-apple-judgment-09072012">original ruling</a> by Judge Colin Birss said Samsung&#8217;s tablets were <a target="_blank" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/jul/09/samsung-apple-cool-ipad-tablet">not cool enough</a> to be confused with Apple&#8217;s because they lacked the &#8220;extreme simplicity&#8221; of the iPad. That ruling has now been upheld by the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p>The original ruling also stated that Apple must run adverts on its website and in newspaper saying Samsung did not copy the iPad. <a target="_blank" href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/10/18/us-apple-samsung-idUKBRE89H0DW20121018">Reuters</a> reports that the Court of Appeal&#8217;s Judge Kitchin said today the notices must be in a font size no smaller than Ariel 14.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Apple and Samsung for comment and will update with any response.</p>
<p>The BBC quotes a Samsung spokeswoman providing the following statement</p>
<blockquote><p>We continue to believe that Apple was not the first to design a tablet with a rectangular shape and rounded corners and that the origins of Apple&#8217;s registered design features can be found in numerous examples of prior art.</p>
<p>Should Apple continue to make excessive legal claims in other countries based on such generic designs, innovation in the industry could be harmed and consumer choice unduly limited.</p></blockquote>
