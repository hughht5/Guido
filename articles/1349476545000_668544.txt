<p>The firm was founded in 1986 and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.trinityventures.com/home/about/">says</a> it makes seed and early-stage deals on companies in cloud and mobile infrastructure, digital media, software as a service, social commerce, and entertainment. This is Trinity&#8217;s 11th fund. When it last raised $300 million in 2009, general partner <a target="_blank" href="http://www.trinityventures.com/2009/04/23/trinity-ventures-closes-300-million-trinity-x-fund/">Fred Wang said</a> the firm didn&#8217;t raise a bigger fund so that it could &#8220;continue our strategy of investing selectively in capital-efficient, early stage companies and our commitment to being accessible and responsive board members.&#8221;</p>
<p>Past investments include Aruba Networks, Blue Nile, Extreme Networks, Loopnet, Starbucks, and Wall Data, which have all gone public. More recent additions to the portfolio include <a target="_blank" href="http://pevc.dowjones.com/article?an=DJFVW00020120807e887qxvmt&amp;from=alert&amp;pid=32&amp;ReturnUrl=http%3a%2f%2fpevc.dowjones.com%3a80%2farticle%3fan%3dDJFVW00020120807e887qxvmt%26from%3dalert%26pid%3d32">children&#8217;s clothing marketplace One Jackson</a> and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/22/dotloop-raises-7m-from-trinity-to-kill-real-estate-paperwork/">DotLoop, a startup offering online tools for real estate negotiation</a>.</p>
