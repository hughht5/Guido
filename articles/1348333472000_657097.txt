The Hill <a target="_blank" href="http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/251037-lawmakers-introduce-pandora-backed-music-royalty-legislation">reports</a> that online radio services shell out more than 55% of their revenue to pay off royalty fees, while satellite and cable companies only pay somewhere between 7 and 16 percent, according to co-sponsor Rep Jason Chaffetz&#8217;s office. Like Google and Wikipedia <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/18/congressmen-abandon-sopa/">blacking out their websites</a> in opposition to the Stop Online Piracy Act, Pandora has a captive audience of <a target="_blank" href="http://news.yahoo.com/pandora-touts-more-150-million-users-020504736.html">+150 million users</a> to broadcast their campaign, once again revealing how web giants can transform into powerful media outlets.</p>
<p>The irony was not lost on me that I heard this campaign <em>while I was writing this post</em>.</p>
<p>The Internet Radio Fairness Act revives on-going battle between the typical champions of web firms, Congressmen Issa, Wyden, and Polis, against those of the recording industry lobby, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/anneschroeder/0309/The_NAB_vs_the_RIAAmusicFIRST.html">(RIAA-backed) musicFIRST</a>, who are proposing a law to instead <em>increase</em> satellite radio royalties to the higher rates of Pandora. Both are arguing for equal terms, but one pays more to radio services and less to artists/record labels.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fourteen years ago, when online radio was in its infancy, the incumbent interests were successful at getting laws passed to discriminate against the Internet,&#8221; said Senator Wyden in a statement, who introduced a companion bill in the Senate. &#8220;This bill puts Internet radio on an even plane with its competitors, and allows the music marketplace to evolve and to expand — which will ultimately benefit artists and the Internet economy.”</p>
<p>Recording industry backed musicFIRST released a <a target="_blank" href="http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/244413-nadler-circulates-draft-legislation-on-music-royalties">draft</a> of their alternative bill &#8220;There’s nothing fair about pampering Pandora, with its $1.8 billion market cap, at the expense of music creators,” said Ted Kalo, executive director of musicFIRST. “We support rate parity that addresses the greatest inequity of all, the lack of a performance right for terrestrial radio, and is fair to music creators.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unlike the recording industry, however, Pandora has a ready-made audience of a +150 million users. Should it succeed in getting the bill passed, it will reaffirm how Internet giants can trasform from service providers into powerful media organizations.</p>
<p>The law is unlikely to come to a vote before the end of the year.</p>
