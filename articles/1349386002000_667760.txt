Today&#8217;s entrant in the 3D race? The devilishly cute <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pandarobotics/pandabot-a-friendly-affordable-3d-printer">PandaBot</a>, a &#8220;fur white&#8221; 3D printer with a an 11x11x11-inch build area and a smooth, seamless design.</p>
<p>The bot prints in ABS plastic and has one enclosed print head. All of the major machinery is hidden behind white metal panels and the aforementioned &#8220;Panda&#8221; styling means this doesn&#8217;t look like a junk yard mated with the thing E.T. built in the woods.</p>

<div style="margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px;padding-left:15px;border-left:3px solid #ccc;font-style:italic;">Over the past 9 months we&#8217;ve designed and built our prototype printer. Since it&#8217;s designed as a manufactured product, construction techniques and materials were chosen to make it exceptionally stable, robust, and quiet. Fully encased in metal, the PandaBot is very rigid and quiet. Our design isnâ€™t as susceptible to vibration induced errors as other printers designed to be hand assembled. We&#8217;ve proven this by successfully printing on live national TV with no adjustments in less than 5 minutes from the back of a taxi.</div>
<p>Founded by Torontoans Kelly John Rose and Felix Tang, the project is looking for $50,000 and PandaBots cost $800 for the basic model, which is quite reasonable. Like flowers in the meadow, 3D printers are beautiful and manifold, and this one is more attractive than most.</p>
