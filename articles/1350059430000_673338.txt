<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/wikileaks">Wikileaks</a>, the infamous government document leak service, is now charging for access to some of its files. After the United States championed a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2058141/WikiLeaks-bids-end-credit-card-ban-start-sending-confidential-documents-again.html">global payment system embargo</a> against the site, Wikileaks has been desperate to pay the increasing costs of its Founder Julian Assange&#8217;s legal fees and the site&#8217;s own computing infrastructure. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2011/02/07/wikileaks-finds-new-source-of-funding-t-shirts-and-tote-bags/">Selling tote-bags and t-shirts</a> failed to raise enough money, so Wikileaks has resorted to a paywall, where users must either donate money to access files or share a video through social media, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/10/wikileaks-paywall-anonymous/">reports</a> <em>Wired</em>. The move has invoked the public ire of powerful hacker group, Anonymous, which once attacked down the very financial services boycotting Wikileaks.</p>

<p>“The conclusion for us is that we cannot support anymore what Wikileaks has become – the One Man Julian Assange show. But we also want to make clear that we still support the original idea behind Wikileaks: Freedom of information and transparent governments. Sadly we realize that Wikileaks does not stand for this idea anymore,&#8221; said a message posted by the group on online text-sharing website, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastebin">Pastebin</a>.</p>
<p>Founder Julian Assange <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/16/radical-transparency-1-britain-0-assange-granted-asylum/">is currently walled up in Ecuador&#8217;s UK embassy</a>, as governments around the world attempt to legally penetrate the asylum protections granted by the bullish south American country.</p>
<p>Should Wikileaks fail to stay up, it is unclear what would emerge as the go-to place for leaked documents. Wikileaks <a target="_blank" href="http://articles.cnn.com/2011-01-18/opinion/tunisia.wikileaks_1_tunisians-wikileaks-regime?_s=PM:OPINION">is widely believed</a> to have played an important role in the Arab Spring, after it released documents exposing Tunisia&#8217;s corrupt government. Other media outlets, such as <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1751795/wall-street-journal-launches-wikileaks-competitor">have attempted</a> their own leaked documents services&#8211;without much success.</p>
<p>While Wikileaks has battled with governments <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/29/AR2010112905421.html">and its partners</a>, such as The New York Times, it has also taken steps to obscure information potentially harmful to intelligence officials (though, whether it has done an adequate job <a target="_blank" href="http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/homeland-security/110931-release-of-classified-documents-by-wikileaks-endangers-our-national-security-rep-ike-skelton">is up for debate</a>).</p>
<p>With Wikileaks losing money as well as its online friends, the chaotic world of radical government transparency hangs on its continued existence.</p>
