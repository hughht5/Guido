<p>The event isn&#8217;t a total secret &#8212; there have been tweets <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/mmurph/status/246399517342199808">here and there</a> about it &#8212; but the storied Silicon Valley venture capital firm has kept a tight lid on exactly who has been in attendance. You&#8217;ve got to wonder: What do some of the most highly respected, successful, and powerful people in the tech and financial industries do to recharge and refocus before taking on the busy autumn season?</p>
<p>Well, wonder no more, because TechCrunch has obtained the full schedule. And it&#8217;s absolutely amazing. Here it is (we&#8217;ve omitted some exact location details in the interest of security, but we understand it&#8217;s taking place in the vicinity of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_Beach,_California">Pebble Beach</a>, the tony resort town on California&#8217;s Central Coast):</p>

<p>JP Morgan CEO <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Dimon">Jamie Dimon</a>. Former Secretary of State <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Powell">Colin Powell</a>. Former Vice President (and current KPCB partner) <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/al-gore">Al Gore</a>. As you can see, the event is almost over, but there is still one big guest name left: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/bill-gates">Bill Gates</a>. He will be &#8220;in conversation&#8221; with the Summit&#8217;s attendees. Talk about an important lunch date.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Kleiner Perkins about the schedule, but the firm tells us that there will be no live stream of Gates&#8217; talk or footage of the speakers that have appeared over the past few days. It&#8217;s a strictly private event.</p>
<p>The field of startup investing has leveled out in many ways in recent years with the advent of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/20/the-power-of-angellist-revealed-in-its-new-look-978-done-deals-48-acquisitions/">tools like AngelList</a> and the passage of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/tag/jobs-act/">the JOBS Act</a>. But this shows that while it&#8217;s no longer <em>necessary</em> for startups to head to Sand Hill Road&#8217;s stalwarts for venture capital funding, it can still be a very smart thing to do. Being backed by an A-list firm like Kleiner can be as valuable as ever &#8212; in ways that go beyond the dollars they invest.</p>
