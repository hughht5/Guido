The new funding was led by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/globespan-capital-partners">Globespan Capital Partners</a>, and saw participation from existing investors <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/carmel-ventures">Carmel</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/vertex-venture-capital">Vertex</a> and the Waisbein Fund.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s success is something of a viewpoint into the explosion of the mobile app ecosystem. Today, Perfecto Mobile reports having a customer base of over 600 organizations, and says it has achieved over 100% annual revenue growth. The majority of its customers are developers and SMBs, but 80% of Perfecto&#8217;s revenue comes from enterprise customers. The company counts several big name brands among its enterprise users, including ING Direct, Vodafone, Staples, Coca-Cola, Travelocity, Motorola, and Disney, for example.</p>
<p>Most of the apps tested on its platform are consumer-facing, but that&#8217;s starting to change. With the introduction and popularity of tablets in particular, the company is seeing its platform used for more internal-facing enterprise apps than ever before.</p>
<p>Perfecto&#8217;s core product is its &#8220;MobileCloud&#8221; platform, which consists of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.perfectomobile.com/portal/cms/services/web_access_to_real_handsets.html">MobileCloud-Interactive</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.perfectomobile.com/portal/cms/services/automated_testing.html">MobileCloud-Automation</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.perfectomobile.com/portal/cms/services/monitoring.html">MobileCloud-Monitoring</a> services. Combined, it&#8217;s an all-in-one solution which includes a variety of business needs, like handset validation, offshore testing, multi-vendor collaboration, stress testing, roaming testing, service monitoring, performance benchmarking, and more. The platform allows the businesses to test feature phones, smartphones and tablets in real-time, and all of the testing is done via the cloud. The company claims to cover 99% of the models on the market and can quickly add new models to the platform as they become available.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a cloud-based, flexible environment that allows us to ramp up handsets and change the mix of the handsets in almost zero time&#8230;less than a day,&#8221; says Perfecto CEO Eran Yaniv. He also explains that the platform is differentiated from competitors&#8217; offerings because of its patented environment for creating device-agnostic scripting called ScriptOnce. This allows developers to create a script on a single handset for automation purposes, which can then be used on any handset without changes, assuming the application is similar enough.</p>
<p>Perfecto also benefits by having its platform offered via plugin to the users of HP&#8217;s testing tools suite, which is how around 30% of its install base works with its services.</p>
<p>With the additional funding, Yaniv says the company is focusing on growth and R&amp;D.<br />
&#8220;We decided that we wanted to accelerate our growth, which is why we went fundraising,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to invest a bulk of it in increasing our sales organization globally, as well as our marketing activity.&#8221; Also in the works are plans to broaden its offerings, including new tools for performance testing, security testing (for things that have to do with payments), and other vertical applications. No ETA on any of those just yet, however. Meanwhile, on terms of headcount, Perfecto will likely increase from the 75 people it has now to around 100 by the middle to end of 2013.</p>
