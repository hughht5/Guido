But Facebook has managed to grow its gaming ecosystem 11% to 251 million users this year as it focuses on combatting game spam. And developers are building a more diverse set of games. The only problem? Facebook&#8217;s total user count is still growing faster than its gamer count.</p>
<p>At the end of September last year, Facebook had 226 million people playing Facebook integrated games, and now it has 251 million. The casino, arcade/puzzle, and mid-to-hardcore game categories are growing in popularity as the old farming and simulation game categories are shrinking in market share.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Facebook is seeing game developers coming from a wider set of countries and continents, including Africa, Russia, Australia, and especially Israel, which Facebook&#8217;s Sean Ryan said &#8220;is exploding&#8221; right now.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re still in today&#8217;s Facebook games whiteboard session at Facebook headquarters right now, so we&#8217;ll have more details and analysis soon.</p>
