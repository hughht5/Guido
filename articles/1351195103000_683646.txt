But Facebook has managed to grow its gaming ecosystem 11% to 251 million users this year by focusing on clean . And developers are building a more diverse set of games. The only problem? Facebook&#8217;s total user count is still growing faster than its gamer count.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s head of platform Dan Rose told reporters at a &#8220;whiteboard session&#8221; at Facebook&#8217;s 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park HQ that games has seen a &#8220;real increase in quality over the last 12 months, and in the diversity of the games, genres, and developers.&#8221; Let&#8217;s dive into those trends.</p>
<h4>Quality Leads To Quantity Of Users</h4>
<p>On quality, Facebook&#8217;s director of growth Alex Schultz explained that at times in the past, Facebook was too lenient about how aggressively game developers could spam Facebook users. For example, devs could generate notifications that drowned out alerts about being tagged in photos or someone writing on your wall.</p>
<p>Schultz said &#8220;The channel got burned. There were spammy notifications and we weren&#8217;t adequately policing.&#8221; So users began ignoring game notifications, and Facebook shut them down. But now Facebook has relaunched the channel with a focus on quality. Developers get analytics about if their alerts are being marked as spam, and lose access to the channel if they get flagged to often. Now Schultz says the &#8220;relaunched active user notifications have been fantastically successful&#8230;[with] click through rates in the 30%-40% range.&#8221;</p>
<h4>Games Of All Types From All Over</h4>
<p>At the end of September last year, Facebook had 226 million people playing Facebook-integrated games, and now it has 251 million. The casino, arcade/puzzle, and mid-to-hardcore game categories are growing in popularity as the old farming and simulation game categories are shrinking in market share.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Facebook is seeing game developers coming from a wider set of countries and continents, including Africa, Russia, Australia, and especially Israel, which Facebook&#8217;s Sean Ryan said &#8220;is exploding&#8221; right now. Facebook saw 450 gaming developers attend a recent meetup in Israel, a country of fewer than 8 million people.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re still in today&#8217;s Facebook games whiteboard session at Facebook headquarters right now, so we&#8217;ll have more details and analysis soon.</p>
