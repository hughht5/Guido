The new model, which many believe should have been launched with the first batch of 8 and 16GB slates, should sell for less than the 16GB model.</p>
<p>Interestingly, because of the pricing, the 32GB could replace the 16GB entirely although I personally find the 8GB that I have to be the unfortunate runt of the litter with too little space for anything interesting.</p>
<p>AndroidPolice is suggesting that the October 18th launch is probably not going to happen but, like the wise old owl once said of a Tootsie Pop, the world may never know.</p>
