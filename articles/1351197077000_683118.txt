<p>The company also recorded profits of <strong>$8.2 billion</strong> (compared to $8.8 billion in Q3, and $6.62 billion in Q4 2011), which works out to diluted earnings of <strong>$8.67 per share</strong>. </p>
<p>As Fortune’s <a target="_blank" href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/10/25/all-eyes-on-apples-earnings-3/">Philip Elmer-DeWitt</a> pointed out earlier today, analysts have been tweaking their estimates in response to CEO Tim Cook’s announcement that the company has sold over 100 million iPads &#8212; the implication being that some of their more ambitious iPad sales estimates were off-base. The <a target="_blank" href="http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/earnings/earnings.asp?ticker=AAPL">earlier earnings consensus</a> hovered around an EPS of $8.84 on $36.2 billion in revenue, but ultimately dipped to $8.75 EPS and $35.8 billion in revenue. Apple just barely managed to beat those estimates with regard to revenue, but still missed when it came to earnings &#8212; though it should be noted that expectations were all over the place. </p>

<p>As always, Apple’s own forecast for Q4 was considerably more modest — as CFO Oppenheimer noted in last quarter&#8217;s release, the company expected to pull in roughly $34 billion in revenue, and diluted EPS of “about $7.65.” With the all-important holiday buying season nearly upon us, Oppenheimer sought to keep expectations in check with yet another &#8220;conservative&#8221; estimate: the company expects revenues of about $52 billion and diluted earnings per share of about $11.75.” </p>
<p>Apple reported selling a total of 26.9 million iPhones in Q4, a decent little bump from the 26 million iPhones Apple sold in Q3 but still not quite up to Wall Street’s expectations; <a target="_blank" href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/10/17/how-many-iphones-did-apple-sell-last-quarter-7/">Fortune</a> pegged the median analyst estimate at roughly 27 million units sold. But how many of those were iPhone 5s? Sadly, aside from a self-congratulatory press release noting that &#8220;over 5 million&#8221; iPhone 5s were sold during the device&#8217;s opening weekend, the company has been hesitant to trot out specific numbers and still doesn&#8217;t break down iPhone sales by model. As it turns out though, iPad sales were down this quarter at 14 million units sold (Apple sold a whopping 17 million in Q3), though that&#8217;s at least partially thanks to the finally-fulfilled rumors of an iPad mini keeping sales at bay.</p>
<p>All things considered this quarter was a mixed bag for Apple, but it&#8217;s also essentially the quiet before the storm &#8212; the holiday buying frenzy is poised to kick off in earnest in just a few weeks, and (in case you hadn&#8217;t noticed) Apple refreshed nearly all of its consumer product lines in one fell swoop just two days ago, including ones that arguably didn&#8217;t need fiddling with for a while. The unveilings of the iPad mini, the 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro, and the redesigned iMacs and Mac minis all seemed tailor-made to drive a downright huge Q1 2013 for the company, though the bar has already been set awfully high. </p>
<p>Case in point: Apple raked in an expletive-generating $46 billion in Q1 2012, handily exceeding just about every estimate out there by a fair margin. Before we all get caught up in what may happen down the road though, Apple&#8217;s customary earnings conference call is slated to begin at 5:00PM Eastern &#8212; keep your eyes peeled for more.</p>
