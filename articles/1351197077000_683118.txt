The company also recorded profits of $8.2 billion (compared to $8.8 billion in Q3, and $6.62 billion in Q4 2011), which works out to diluted earnings of $8.67 per share.</p>
<p>As Fortune’s <a target="_blank" href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/10/25/all-eyes-on-apples-earnings-3/">Philip Elmer-DeWitt</a> pointed out earlier today, analysts have been tweaking their estimates in response to CEO Tim Cook’s announcement that the company has sold over 100 million iPads &#8212; the implication being that some of their more ambitious iPad sales estimates were off-base. The <a target="_blank" href="http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/earnings/earnings.asp?ticker=AAPL">earlier earnings consensus</a> hovered around an EPS of $8.84 on $36.2 billion in revenue, but ultimately dipped to $8.75 EPS and $35.8 billion in revenue.</p>

<p>As always, Apple’s own forecast for Q4 was considerably more modest — as CFO Oppenheimer noted in last quarter&#8217;s release, the company expected to pull in roughly $34 billion in revenue, and diluted EPS of “about $7.65.” With the all-important holiday buying season nearly upon us, Oppenheimer sought to keep expectations in check with yet another conservative estimate: the company expects revenues of about $52 billion and diluted earnings per share of about $11.75.”</p>
