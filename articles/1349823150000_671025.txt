The smartphone is LG&#8217;s flagship Android device, and has the specs to own that role, with a Quad-Core 1.5GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro Processor and 4.7-inch1280 x 768 pixel display. Back in September, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/19/lgs-quad-core-flagship-optimus-g-to-make-u-s-debut-in-q4-we-go-hands-on/">Chris went hands-on with the international version</a>, and today at CTIA MobileCon we took the Sprint version for a spin.</p>
<p>The Sprint version boasts the same camera as its international cousin, a 13-megapixel monster that outdoes the 8-megapixel version on the AT&amp;T iteration of the phone. As you can see below, the extra pixels capture a lot of detail, but I still think colors in general look more washed out than on competing devices like the iPhone 5, despite the extra resolution. Photos look great on the device&#8217;s own screen, however, due in part to the 318 ppi display.</p>
<p>The hardware on Sprint&#8217;s version is consistent with others, meaning a plastic case that&#8217;s screwed to the front faceplate, an unusual design choice for Android handsets that normally feature a pop-off back and more easily accessible battery. Still, the design choice works in the Optimus G&#8217;s favor – construction feels solid despite primarily plastic materials, and the weight of the phone overall feels very satisfying in the hand. Buttons are kept to a minimum, with only three total sticking out from the device (volume up/down and power). The minimalist approach is nice, keeping the overall look satisfyingly spare.</p>
<p>Despite running Android 4.0.4, instead of Jelly Bean, the Sprint LG Optimus G felt very snappy. Transitions between screens and apps were butter-smooth, and there wasn&#8217;t any kind of lag I could detect in any applications I tried out. The phone is no doubt taking full advantage of its quad-core processing power to make that happen. And speaking of processors, LG&#8217;s included an eco mode to maximize battery life over power, in order to get the most out of the phone&#8217;s 2,100 mAh battery, which LG says can provide up to 13 hours of talk time.</p>
<p>All told, this is a powerful, solid option in the Android field. Is it a particularly exciting one? That&#8217;s up for debate. Check out the gallery below for more on this device, including sample shots taken with the smartphone&#8217;s camera.
