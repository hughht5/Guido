Nevertheless, the company&#8217;s engineers clearly believed that the test wasn&#8217;t &#8220;real-world&#8221; enough and today, Microsoft <a target="_blank" href="http://windowsteamblog.com/ie/b/ie/archive/2012/09/25/internet-explorer-10-may-score-well-with-robohornet-but-it-s-even-better-for-web-browsing-in-the-real-world.aspx">launched</a> a <a target="_blank" href="http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/performance/robohornetpro/">new version</a> of RoboHornet that expands the test to simulate typical browser scenarios better.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://windowsteamblog.com/ie/b/ie/archive/2012/09/25/internet-explorer-10-may-score-well-with-robohornet-but-it-s-even-better-for-web-browsing-in-the-real-world.aspx">According to</a> Microsoft&#8217;s director of Internet Explorer marketing Roger Capriotti, Microsoft&#8217;s own <a target="_blank" href="http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/performance/robohornetpro/">RoboHornet Pro</a>, which takes its visual cues from the Matrix movies, takes RoboHornet&#8217;s micro-benchmark approach and runs it &#8220;in the context of a real-world scenario.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most of today&#8217;s browser benchmarks like Sunspider, Kraken and Google&#8217;s recently launched <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/21/google-octane-benchmark/">Octane</a> focus on JavaScript, but in Google&#8217;s view (and that of many other browser developers), JavaScript is rarely a bottleneck for modern web apps.</p>
<p>RoboHornet Pro uses modern web technologies like CSS3 Animations, CSS3 Transforms, CSS3 Text Shadows, custom WOFF fonts, Unicode and Touch. Running Microsoft&#8217;s tests, Chrome &#8211; as expected &#8211; performs significantly worse than Internet Explorer (and Firefox, too, beats Chrome in our strictly non-scientific tests). Chrome, says Microsoft, &#8220;wasn’t designed to handle a benchmark load in the context of a real-world scenario.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most vendor benchmarks, of course, favor their own developers&#8217; products, so the fact that Microsoft does much better here doesn&#8217;t come as a big surprise. Microsoft has consistently said that real-world performance <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/02/08/focusing-on-real-world-web-performance-with-internet-explorer-9.aspx">matters more</a> than benchmarks. If anything, though, the rivalry between the top browser vendors and this focus on speed has pushed browser performance forward considerably over the last few years.</p>
