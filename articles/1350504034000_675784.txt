And if you don&#8217;t want to strap your phone to your arm and baste it in sweat, there are even a few dedicated fitness-friendly gizmos, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.apple.com/uk/ipod/nike/">Apple&#8217;s Nike + iPod</a> in-shoe system, <a target="_blank" href="http://nikeplus.nike.com/plus/products/fuelband">Nike&#8217;s Fuelband</a> wristband or <a target="_blank" href="http://www.motorola.com/us/consumers/8GB-or-16GB-MOTOACTV/79070,en_US,pd.html">Motorola&#8217;s MotoACTIV</a>. But none of these devices are especially intelligent &#8212; they tend to track total steps, distance, calories, and that&#8217;s about it (unless you start adding additional accessories such as heart-monitor chest straps).</p>
<p>Enter <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amiigo.co/">Amiigo</a>: a fitness app and lightweight plastic bracelet (with detachable shoe-clip) that can identify the type of exercise you&#8217;re doing and tell you how well you&#8217;re doing it as you&#8217;re doing it, thanks to a variety of sensors analysing how your body is responding as you run, bike, swim (yes it&#8217;s waterproof), or whatever your preferred exercise poison.</p>
<p>Amiigo&#8217;s gesture-based software algorithms identify the different types of exercises you&#8217;re engaged in &#8212; and should improve over time as the software learns more about your movements, according to the startup. Having both a bracelet and a shoe clip helps its system distinguish between a pull-up and a bicep curl, say, although you don&#8217;t always have to wear both. To generate real-time fitness data, the hardware includes a variety of sensors that track variables such as your heart rate. The device includes motion sensors/accelerometers to track how you&#8217;re moving, plus an infrared sensor to monitor blood oxygen levels. The bracelet also incorporates a stainless steel plate to measure skin temperature.</p>
<p>Then the corresponding Amiigo iOS and Android apps allow you to view the data, set fitness goals and custom challenges, share workouts in real-time (which won&#8217;t be <em>at all</em> annoying&#8230;) and accrue fitness points for bragging rights and/or the chance to redeem them against discounts on fitness gear.</p>
<p>The startup reckons no one else in this space is doing gesture recognition to track activity type and response in such granular detail &#8212; at least not using just one main wearable device &#8212; which in turn allows it to provide detailed feedback via the app in order to act as a virtual personal trainer.</p>
<p>The startup is kicking off an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/indie-gogo">Indiegogo</a> on October 29 with the aim of raising $90,000, and hopes to be ready to ship in April 2013. First taker backers will be able to snag the device for an extremely tasty price of $89, after which it will be sold for $119 &#8212; which is still pretty neat considering it undercuts some of Amiigo&#8217;s less-capable competitor devices.</p>
<p>Also neat: Amiigo will be releasing an SDK for the device so app makers can explore additional uses. The startup tells me it could envisage various alternative use-cases for the hardware, such as enhanced patient care monitoring or chronic care monitoring, or &#8212; tapping up the Wii-style motion sensors inside Amiigo &#8212; even gaming scenarios.</p>
<p>The startup has been working on the device for around 10 months so far &#8212; with a core team of four, including &#8220;tech talent&#8221; from MIT.</p>
