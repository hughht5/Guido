<p>If you&#8217;ll recall, Microsoft hasn&#8217;t been completely forthcoming with its newest mobile operating system &#8212; devices running Windows Phone 8 have been carefully controlled (even in the midst of a tumultuous press event), but that should all change today. Anyway, the show is set to begin shortly, so stay tuned!</p>
