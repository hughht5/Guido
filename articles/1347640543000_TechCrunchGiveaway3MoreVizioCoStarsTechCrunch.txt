<p>The Vizio Co-Star <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/26/vizio-sells-out-co-star-stream-player-in-under-12-hours/">sold out pre-orders</a> in the first 12 hours it was available but we got our hands on more of this coveted itty-bitty gadget. It is small enough to fit in the palm of your hand and so does the fancy, dual-sided QWERTY remote it ships with.</p>
<p>With special thanks to Vizio, we have another three Co-Stars to give away. The giveaway starts now and ends next Friday, September 21st, at 9AM Pacific Time.
