Naturally, Sharethrough has been offering services around native video ads, but now it&#8217;s announcing <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sharethrough.com/sponsored-videos/">Sharethrough Sponsored Videos</a>, a platform that Greenberg says should make native ads viable for a much broader group of publishers and advertisers.</p>
<p>When Greenberg talks about &#8220;native&#8221; ads, he means ads that don&#8217;t look like your traditional ads, and instead like an organic part of the website. It needs to be clearly marked as advertising, but when a reader/viewer looks at it, it should register as another type of content, rather than some random crap they can ignore.</p>
<p>So Sharethrough allows publishers to incorporate sponsored videos in three standard layouts — the feed, the gallery, and the grid. In the grid, for example, the video appears as just another item in the grid. Or if we added the sponsored video to TechCrunch (this is just hypothetical — I&#8217;m not aware of any plans to do this), it could show up as just another post in the feed, or maybe one of the links in the four featured stories at the top of the page.</p>
<p>Again, Sharethrough (and other companies) were already offering these types of ads, but Greenberg says the company is now standardizing the process. Without the platform, an advertiser would have to contact the publishers directly, and then the publisher would have to deal with the headache of manually inserting the video into the right spot on the page. Now, advertisers can place their ads with a number of publishers, and publishers can just slide those ads into the placements that they&#8217;ve already created. The process still requires some &#8220;white glove&#8221; management from Sharethrough (for example, the company works with publishers to determine where the native ad should be placed and how it should be formatted), but Greenberg is hoping to fully automate the process in time.</p>

<p>Publishers can also create include custom text and images for each ad. So even though advertisers get the scale of an ad network, to the viewer each placement should look like it was custom-built.</p>
<p>The Awl Network, Forbes, Thought Catalog are already on the platform, Sharethrough says.</p>
<p>Greenberg argues that this benefits viewers, too, because it makes publishers less willing to tolerate crappy ads. If you&#8217;ve got a weird weight loss ad pushed off as a banner on the side of your website, that may not seem like a big deal, but if it&#8217;s a video in your main content stream, and your viewers hate it, you&#8217;re not going to put up with it. And while he isn&#8217;t ready to make any specific product announcements around mobile, Greenberg also says that&#8217;s an environment where these native ads make sense, because there&#8217;s less screen real estate for banners.</p>
