<p>Wrote <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sex.com">Sex.com</a> [NSFW] founder Iain MacNeil:</p>
<div style="margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px;padding-left:15px;border-left:3px solid #ccc;font-style:italic;">Without contacting us, Pinterest banned all activity from Sex.com. Pinterest users can no longer pin any content from Sex.com nor can they view the site from older pins. We&#8217;ve unjustly been marked as spam. Our attempts to contact Pinterest have been fruitless. We want to know why they banned their adult community from seeing an alternative. Is it as simple as Pinterest is afraid of losing the adult content community despite the fact they do not respect users who use their site for adult content? Or is it that Pinterest does not believe a female audience for Sex.com is inappropriate?
</div>
<p>To be clear, Pinterest <a target="_blank" href="http://pinterest.com/source/art-or-porn.com/">contains porn [NSFW]</a>. Maybe it&#8217;s not full bore wingwom on dingslap action, but it&#8217;s there. Think of it as the <em>50 Shades Of Grey</em> kind of stuff rather than the two-girls-one-bazinga-style porn you&#8217;re thinking of. You know, classy stuff.</p>
<p>Now, however, photos sourced from sex.com will be marked as spam. &#8220;The most exciting prospect of Sex.com being linked through Pinterest was not just the potential growth for our site but also appealing to a female audience,&#8221; said MacNeil. That&#8217;s all over now.</p>
<p>&#8220;In all official Pinterest Terms of Service they claim that pins are the responsibility of the user. So on what grounds do they have the right to supersede the user&#8217;s ability to pin from Sex.com?&#8221;</p>
<p>While this sounds a lot like an aggrieved pornographer fighting back against a frigid corporation, Pinterest makes its money (or is trying to make its money) by banking on content that other people have created. If they don&#8217;t want some of the most popular content in the world on their site, fine. But they have to either say no wee woos and ping baps as all or let the hoo hoo floodgates open.</p>
