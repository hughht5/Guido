Toronto is sold out and Chicago and Detroit are nearly at capacity as well. More than 3,000 people have RSVP&#8217;d for our three meetups that span just five days. Stuff a bunch of business cards into your best tweed blazer, load a pitch deck on your phone, and perfect your elevator pitch. These meetups are great!</p>
<p>We&#8217;re attempting to make the most of our short time in each city and thus will be holding office hours the morning of the meetup. John, Jordan, Colleen, Darrell and myself are very excited to hear what you&#8217;re working on. We&#8217;ve selected a local coffee shop in each city, and because of the sheer number of requests, we&#8217;re also holding office hours in Ann Arbor, MI the morning of the Detroit meetup.</p>
<p>For each city, there are several 20 minute slots available for each TechCrunch staffer. This will give you plenty of time to explain your startup or app and how you&#8217;re going to take over the world. We&#8217;ll do our best to honor your request for a specific TC writer, but if you sign up, one of us will be sure to talk to you. <a target="_blank" href="http://techcrunch.ohours.org/">Sign up on our Ohours event page here</a>.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, there are no more tickets available for <a href="http://techcrunch.com/events/toronto-meetup/">Toronto</a>; <a href="http://techcrunch.com/events/detroit-meetup/">Detroit</a> and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/events/chicago-meetup/">Chicago</a> are nearly gone, too. RSVP for these free meetups now.</p>
