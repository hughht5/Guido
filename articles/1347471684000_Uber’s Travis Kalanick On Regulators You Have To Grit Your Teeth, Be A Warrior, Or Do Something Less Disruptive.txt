Today, the company&#8217;s founder and CEO, Travis Kalanick, came out swinging with strong words for his competitors and the bodies that regulate all of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every city we go to eventually the regulators will make something up to keep us from rolling out or continuing our  business,&#8221; he told an audience at TC Disrupt in San Francisco. Talking about the tos and fros that have followed Uber to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/09/dc-city-councils-uber-amendment-would-force-sedans-to-charge-5x-taxi-prices-and-kill-uberx/">Washington</a> and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/15/uber-boston-green-light/">Boston</a>, he suggests that the struggle to grow is services may not be over. &#8220;Just because we have rolled out does not mean they like you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also noted that one of the big issues for Uber has been that working in completely new areas of technology, it&#8217;s found that regulators put the brakes on in cases where it hasn&#8217;t actually established rules, for example in the case of how to implement standards for in-car GPS services in Boston, or how to charge for trips that cost over $25 (a recent issue in NYC).</p>
<p>&#8220;A regulator is supposed to create and enforce a standard. If they don&#8217;t have a standard, that doesn&#8217;t make it illegal.&#8221; He notes that this is the argument Uber has been using in cases like the recent one over GPS in Boston, where the company was issued with a cease-and-desist on its operation. &#8220;We said there&#8217;s no standard here, and 24 hours after that, the Governor of Masssachusetts rescinded the C&amp;D.&#8221; That got a huge round of applause from the audience here in San Francisco.</p>
<p>In New York the solution has been even more disruptive: &#8220;We will roll this out for free and then talk about the credit card processing issue. Our view is that credit card processing is legal.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also pointed out how regulator intransigence has been behind some of Uber&#8217;s reputation as a premium service: &#8220;In DC they tried to set a floor on our pricing; they tried to say we could not charge less than 5 times a cab,&#8221; he said. That effectively meant that the regulator was saying: &#8220;We will only allow this quality service to exist only for rich people.&#8221;</p>
