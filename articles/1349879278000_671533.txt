Financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed.</p>
<p>Tout’d is embracing its new acquisition with two open arms: not only is it integrating Villij’s platform into its own, but it is also rebranding as Villij, “to more accurately reflect the benefits of the online community,” to company said in a statement today.</p>
<p>Along with the new name, and as a result of the integration, Villij is relaunching its website with a host of new features.</p>
<p>The main one of these is social search, where users can look at what other people have been searching for on the site based on keywords and phrases. Other updates include closer integration with Facebook and Gmail, an updated mobile web app, notifications, and maps &#8212; all of which are fairly essential table stakes for any socially-focused service today.</p>
<p>While (the original) Villij was one of the earlier movers in social search and social graphs, Tout&#8217;d launched only in June of this year and in July announced a $1.4 million seed round led by Warner Hill Angels and including no less than 25 other investors.</p>
<p>The move signifies a more aggressive phase for the combined company. Expanding what a user can do on (the new) Villij gives it more ways to attract users and then keep them engaged on the site. While users are still tied to their own social networks of users, it also gives them a way of seeing what others who are not in their networks are also doing. It also helps it better compete against the likes of Facebook. For its part, Facebook in July made a foray into social recommendations through the launch of a <a target="_blank" href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/facebook-introduces-social-recommendations-bar-130140051.html">news Recommendations plug-in</a> &#8211; combining that concept with its Offers service for local businesses could be one potential competitive threat for Villij.</p>
<p>&#8220;The acquisition of Villij allows us to provide our users with more functionality within the site and enhance the way they share experiences and insights with one another through our fully redesigned platform,&#8221; said Rob Morelli, a co-founder of Tout’d, in a statement. Morelli&#8217;s co-founders are Saro Cutri and Arron Kallenberg, who, like Villij, is also a TechStars 2007 alum from its inaugural class.</p>
