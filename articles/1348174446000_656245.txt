GAAP earnings per share were $0.41, up 15% compared to last year while non-GAAP earnings per share were up 11% to $0.53. Analysts expected $0.53 in earnings per share on $8.4 billion in revenue</p>
<p>GAAP new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues were up 5% to $1.6 billion, while non-GAAP new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues were up 6% to $1.6 billion. Both GAAP and non-GAAP software license updates and product support revenues were up 3% to $4.1 billion. Both GAAP and non-GAAP hardware systems products revenues were down 24% to $779 million.</p>
<p>Despite the mixed results, Oracle President and CFO, Safra Catz seems optimistic. “Q1 operating cash flow increased to a record high of $5.7 billion. We’re off to a good start in the new year.”</p>
<p>“A little more than a week from now we will announce lots of enhancements to the Oracle Cloud,” said Oracle CEO, Larry Ellison. “There are more CRM, ERP and HCM applications as a service, and more Oracle database, Java and social network platform services. Our new infrastructure as a service is available in the Oracle Cloud and as a private cloud in our customers’ data center, with the unique ability to move applications and services back and forth between the two.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oracle President, Mark Hurd said that the company expects to double engineered systems sales to well over $1 billion. And Oracle’s new cloud business is also approaching a $1 billion annual run rate. He says these two businesses will &#8220;drive Oracle’s growth for years to come.”</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not surprising that both Ellison and Hurd point to the cloud as one of Oracle&#8217;s main drivers in the future. As we&#8217;ve <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/09/open-yeah-sure-sorry-oracle-youre-still-full-of-it/">written in the past</a>, Oracle has been &#8220;cloudwashing&#8221; of late.</p>
