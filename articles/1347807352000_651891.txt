<p>The Chilean Pavilion joined the rosted of other Latin American startups at TechCrunch Disrupt in San Francisco last week. Our task was to show you as many of them as we could in as short amount of time as possible &#8211; that meant a fast run through with a camera. Thus we found companies doing facial recognition, ad retargeting, opinion polls, algorithmic trading and a social network for freelancers, amongst others.</p>
