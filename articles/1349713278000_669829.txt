The news is not exactly an advert for Paris&#8217;s tech ecosystem, but it may also of course be a function of the weird market right now, especially post Facebook/Zynga/Groupon IPO. Whatever the case, Twitter has confirmed to us that although they have been looking for people to staff its planned Paris office, nothing is shaking so far. A spokesperson told us: &#8220;We&#8217;ve said for a long time that we&#8217;ll eventually have an office in Paris. [We have] Nothing specific to announce (about when or what roles will be there) at this point.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s something of a mystery why this has happened. Twitter put a London office in place some time ago and has already placed it&#8217;s European HQ Dublin, where corporation tax has lead others such as Yahoo, Google and others. We&#8217;ve done some digging into this and there&#8217;s an indication that Twitter is either setting its bar pretty high, (as well they might), or that there is a lack of, well, <em>direction</em>?</p>
<p>Contacts we&#8217;ve spoken to say they have been bashing their heads with Twitter&#8217;s HR people for some time this year, but, as one put it to us, &#8220;It looks like they don&#8217;t know what they want, or <em>who they want</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>The process for hiring a Paris team &#8211; built largely to engage with French advertising agencies around the platform &#8211; started in March, apparently when Jack Dorsey came to Paris and met the candidates of the French Presidential election.</p>
<p>Indeed, the wooing was mutual. In the Spring the mayor of Paris went to SF and visited Twitter, later <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/BertrandDelanoe/status/251407905155330048">tweeting about Twitter opening an office in Paris</a>. Perhaps he tweeted too soon?</p>
<p>In April, Twitter&#8217;s HR machine spun up to try and pull names together. Contacts on the ground in Paris were called, names were sent, mainly for a country manager, to but also for account managers. The tech and media echo-system in Paris did their best to help out, we gather.</p>
<p>There are unconfirmed rumours that Twitter is also looking for an additional person to run operations for other French-speaking countries (Belgium, but also Morocco for example).</p>
<p>Then in June, Katie Stanton, Twitter&#8217;s head of international came to Paris with some other people from her team, and ran a number of interviews. There was also a Twitter developer meetup.</p>
<p>But, inexplicably, no one was selected for the Paris office.</p>
<p>Time passed over the Summer and other people were contacted. And we last heard that the hiring conversations <strong>were still going on in September</strong>. Tough gig huh.</p>
<p>So, that dear reader, is what we know for now. Any more information will be gladly received on the situation.</p>
<p>For now Twitter says it&#8217;s not announcing anything, France-wise.</p>
<p>C&#8217;est le bordel ?</p>
