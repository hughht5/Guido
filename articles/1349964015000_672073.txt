<p>Frank &amp; Oak, which was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/15/frank-and-oak/">founded in February</a>, aims to provide a personalized shopping experience for men. Guys can visit the site and enter their clothing preferences. Once a month you get an email newsletter with a list of items for sale, curated to your interests. You select up to five items, which are then shipped to you free of charge. The ones you don&#8217;t like, or that don&#8217;t fit, you send back, and you pay for the ones you keep.</p>
<p>The company says it has experienced double-digit, month-over-month growth since its launch.</p>
<p>What makes Frank &amp; Oak different from Trunk Club, which as a similar model, is that the startup designs the clothing, and it has direct relationships with the manufacturers. Because of this, Frank &amp; Oak can offer its inventory at a relatively low-price price point. Shirts cost about $40 and accessories cost about $25.</p>
<p>Frank &amp; Oak will use the funding to further develop personalized products, hire more staff and expand the range of clothing and lifestyle products offered.</p>
