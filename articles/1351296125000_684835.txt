<p>The round comes from digital holding company <a target="_blank" href="http://www.navitrio.com">Navitrio</a>. The firm, which also offers its portfolio companies office space and administrative services, previously invested $500,000 in Cemmerce last year. Navitrio co-founder Dror Liwer is also co-founder and CEO at Cemmerce.</p>
<p>Cemmerce pitches itself as a new way for publishers to monetize their content. You just add a few lines of code to your site, or install one of Cemmerce&#8217;s plug-ins for WordPress, Blogger, or Tumblr. Then the company will automatically scan the text for product names and add affiliate links  allowing visitors to purchase the item on various e-commerce sites. Cemmerce makes an affiliate fee from the purchases, which it splits with the publisher.</p>

<p>There are other companies offering automatic affiliate linking, such as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.viglink.com">VigLink</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.skinlinks.com">Skimlinks</a>. However, Cemmerce isn&#8217;t just creating standard affiliate links. Instead, users who mouse over a link open up a &#8220;Cemmerce bubble&#8221;, which displays the four best prices for the product.</p>
<p>Cemmerce also offers dynamic banner ads, and publishers can add &#8220;Buy Now&#8221; links to the end of articles, allowing users to purchase the products that they just read about.</p>
