The problem that I&#8217;ve always had is that I don&#8217;t have one central place to put those photos. Sure, there&#8217;s Flickr and iPhoto, but I haven&#8217;t found a great solution that lets me host photos and share them in a useful way.</p>
<p>I <a target="_blank" href="http://thenextweb.com/apps/2012/08/15/snapjoy-launches-new-importing-tool-nows-time-call-favorite-photo-service/">met the Snapjoy team over a year ago</a>, a young group of guys from Boulder. They set out to solve a huge set of problems, mostly because they wanted the service for themselves. Where do you put all of your photos and how do you interact with them once they&#8217;re in one place? That&#8217;s what Snapjoy, a Y Combinator product, has done with its service.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/26/snapjoy-prepares-for-full-launch-adds-brilliant-copy-feature-to-its-photo-offering/snapshot-92612-440-pm/" rel="attachment wp-att-660906"></a></p>
<p>One of my favorite features of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.snapjoy.com">Snapjoy</a> is &#8220;Shuffle&#8221;, which lets you go through all of your photos one at a time, randomly. Sounds simple, but it&#8217;s pretty amazing. Another new feature has been released called &#8220;Copy.&#8221;</p>
<p>What Copy does is allow you to pull in photos shared with me on my Snapjoy Timeline. Mind you, Snapjoy nailed the Timeline concept way before other big companies did. Ahem, Facebook.</p>
<p>Once you pick the photo shared with you that you like, simply click copy and you&#8217;ll be able to save it as your own. Only thing is Snapjoy hosts one photo, not multiple copies. This is a great feature for when you&#8217;re on vacation or hanging with friends. Simply copy the photos you want to keep for your own collections and bam&#8230;done. No downloading, no importing.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a quick video demo of the feature:</p>

<p>Anyone can sign up right now, but the future pricing plans aren&#8217;t available yet. Once they are, I think that you&#8217;ll be very impressed. You can import your photos from Flickr, Picasa, Instagram, or upload them yourself, and it&#8217;s honestly a work of art once you get everything imported.</p>
