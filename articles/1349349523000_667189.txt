In recent times it&#8217;s become so common to have a conference about early stage startups that almost no-one has really concentrated on this crucial life-cycle for companies, and perhaps the only other contender for this discussion has be <a target="_blank" href="http://www.noah-conference.com/">NOAH in London</a> which tends to attract late stage VC and Private Equity. So it&#8217;s refreshing to see founder <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/fduvall">Farley Duvall</a> continue to plough this furrow. Duvall piloted Red Herring&#8217;s brand in Europe for many years, but with the decline of that brand he has struck out with his own, so he&#8217;s as much an entrepreneur as the tech companies he puts on stage. Some of the companies are familiar, some aren&#8217;t, but it&#8217;s an instructive filter on the market.</p>
<p>Part of the event is the Bully Awards where tech companies are highlighted for their particular interest to the attendees. This year Swedish companies have topped the list of winners (chosen from 60 companies) with nine companies represented, followed by Finland with four companies, Spain and the United Kingdom with three.</p>
<p>The awards like to divide up the companies into three categories.</p>
<p>Thus, the 2012 Bully Award winners include:</p>
