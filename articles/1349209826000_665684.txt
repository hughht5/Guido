<p>Sheryl Sandberg confirmed yes, and referenced Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg&#8217;s comments about the failure of Facebook&#8217;s HTML 5 efforts at TechCrunch Disrupt. Sandberg implied that these sorts of failures were part of the company&#8217;s strategy: purposefully going big even if it means failure or slow monetization.</p>
<p>“You want these companies taking risks,” co-interviewee Marc Andreessen said, defending Facebook’s moves. “When tech companies start being conservative, that’s when they go completely sideways.”</p>
<p>Andreessen also referenced a &#8220;hit rate for new ideas&#8221;: &#8220;If a company is hitting more than 50% of its goals it&#8217;s too conservative.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandberg went on, quoting Mark Zuckerberg, “There are two ways to fail: either you don’t hit your plan, or your plans are too conservative and you hit it quarter after quarter as you slide out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our plans are big and bold, aggressive enough risk taking,&#8221; Sandberg explained, &#8220;So the times we hit them they&#8217;re big enough that they achieve the growth we want to achieve for our company.&#8221;</p>
<p>While every new technology brings fears, the two basically agreed that you don’t win by playing it safe. “We are more afraid of winning by standing still than by not changing,” Sandberg said.</p>
