The Times is soliciting feedback from its users about the app and its features, which suggests that it&#8217;s looking at this as a way to experiment with a non-native delivery method, but isn&#8217;t quite sure about how consumers will respond.</p>
<p>This move by the NYT couldn&#8217;t be more timely. We&#8217;ve just seen the release of a survey from indicating that mobile <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/01/tablet-owners-read-more-news-longer-articles-report/">news consumption is moving from apps to the web</a>, a trend which may be ratcheting up along with the changing picture of the tablet market, which shows that the iPad&#8217;s majority reach could be giving up <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bgr.com/2012/08/01/ipad-market-share-q2-2012-android-tablets/">some ground to Android competitors</a>, though that&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bgr.com/2012/07/25/ipad-market-share-q2-2012-tablets/">disputed by other claims</a>. Whatever the actual numbers, with fresh new low-cost Amazon tablets hitting the market, we could be at an inflection point for web apps that serve different kinds of devices.</p>
<p>Still, at the same time, the NYT is clearly promoting this as an iPad-specific venture. According to the press release, it&#8217;s been &#8220;formatted for optimal reading on the iPad,&#8221; and installation instructions include going to app.NYTimes.com via Safari on iPad. They&#8217;re going out of their way to ensure that people still see this as an iPad product, but it represents one they can control.</p>
<p>This looks a lot like a company realizing that it&#8217;s giving up too much control over its financial future to another company. You don&#8217;t have to look far for an analogue: Apple essentially did the same with Google and Google Maps under iOS 6. But it&#8217;s risky for publishers, since we&#8217;ve seen what Apple&#8217;s Newsstand can provide in terms of a digital subscriber bump. <a title="Magazine Publisher Future Charts Path Back To Profitability Thanks To Apple’s Newsstand" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/27/magazine-publisher-future-charts-path-back-to-profitability-thanks-to-apples-newsstand/">Future reports that Newsstand has helped tremendously</a> with its digital magazine publishing business, for instance.</p>
<p>But others have also left the Newsstand nest and tried to strike out on their own. The Financial Times introduced a web app in June 2011, and has since seen its subscriber base climb to outnumber print, with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/08/technology/08ftapp.html">2.7 million users accessing their content via the web app as of July</a>. Watching that progress has probably encouraged the NYT to make this move. And should it also continue to see digital growth, as well as achieve ownership over a greater percentage of resulting revenues, we may see HTML5 become the vector of choice for more news organizations.</p>
