The latest YouTube app serves up new features and a different UI to devices running older installs. And for good reason, too. </p>
<p>Android&#8217;s update scheme often older hardware running older software. Gingerbread, released 2010, accounts for over half of all Android devices with a 57.5% market share among the Android versions. Froyo comes in third with 14% as Ice Cream Sandwich accounts for 20.9%. But now, this update finally provides 71.5% Android devices with the latest YouTube UI.</p>
<p>The new app also allows users to add videos to their YouTube TV queue from their mobile device &#8212; like a watch later option for those using YouTube TV. </p>
<p>The release notes also notes that there are more channels available from Channel Store but fails to details exactly what&#8217;s new.</p>
<p>Get the update from the Google Play app or <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.youtube&amp;hl=en">web interface</a>.</p>
