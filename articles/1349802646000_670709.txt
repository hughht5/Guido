<p>After arriving <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/JadeMcQueen/status/255704326142562305">on stage to Gangnam Style</a> and dropping a few <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/danieloleary/status/255704757971329024">gems</a> (&#8220;last week Oracle finally noticed the cloud. Larry Ellison joined Twitter, sent 1 tweet, and celebrated by buying an island&#8221;), the Box CEO dropped some updates on the company&#8217;s metrics, giving a quick snapshot of its growth over the last year.</p>
<p>The most significant milestones we caught: Box now has more than 140,000 active businesses using its products, which includes 92 percent of the Fortune 500 and 14 million total users. For context, it&#8217;s worth noting that this time last year, around the time of BoxWorks v1, the company was at 7 million users. After crunching some numbers on my graphing calculator, we can safely conclude that Box&#8217;s user base has doubled over the course of the year.</p>
<p>In addition to that, 14,000 developers are now using Box&#8217;s open platform, with the company now seeing 500 million API calls each month. Some other noteworthy stats: Box has seen a 10-fold increase in iOS usage and a 30-fold increase in Android usage over the past year.</p>
<p>Levie qualified this data by saying that &#8220;Box just works faster than the competition, and as much as 10 million times faster in Tokyo,&#8221; which he then punctuated by saying that this part was &#8220;vague but there is a pretty map.&#8221; He then showed a pretty map.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s not so vague: Box has seen a 72 percent increase in the number of businesses that have adopted the product throughout the enterprise. This up-sell and increasing adoption and retention is good news for Box, an exclamation point on the company&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444226904577561043229414150.html">reported $125 million raise this summer</a> at an estimated $1.2 billion valuation. All of which seems to indicate that the company has one destination in mind: An IPO.</p>
