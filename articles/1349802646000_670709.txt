<p>After arriving on stage to Gangam Style and dropping a few gems (&#8220;last week Oracle finally noticed the cloud. Larry Ellison joined Twitter, sent 1 tweet, and celebrated by buying an island&#8221;), the Box CEO said that the company now has more than 140,000 active businesses, 14 million users and 92 percent of the Fortune 500. It&#8217;s worthy of noting that this time last year, around the time of BoxWorks v1, the company was at 7 million users. It&#8217;s doubled over the course of the year.</p>
<p>In addition to that, 14,000 developers are now using Box&#8217;s open platform, with the company now seeing 500 million API calls each month. Some other noteworthy stats: Box has seen a 10-fold increase in iOS usage and a 30-fold increase in Android usage over the past year.</p>
<p>Levie qualified this data by saying that &#8220;Box just works faster than the competition, and as much as 10 million times faster in Tokyo,&#8221; which he then punctuated by saying that this part was &#8220;vague but there is a pretty map.&#8221; He then showed a pretty map.  </p>
<p>What&#8217;s not so vague: Box has seen a 72 percent increase in the number of businesses that have adopted the product throughout the enterprise. This is good news for Box. </p>
