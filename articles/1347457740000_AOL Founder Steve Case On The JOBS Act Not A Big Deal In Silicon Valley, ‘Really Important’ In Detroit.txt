When he spoke at <a target="_blank" href="http://conf.techonomy.com/12-detroit/overview">the Techonomy Detroit conference</a> today, Case elaborated on why the JOBS Act is going to be a big deal.</p>
<p>In Silicon Valley, Case said, crowdfunding probably won&#8217;t be &#8220;that important or helpful,&#8221; because there&#8217;s already &#8220;tons of money and venture capitalists.&#8221; In areas like Detroit, however, it could be &#8220;really important.&#8221; The Securities and Exchange Commission is still translating the legislation into specific rules, but eventually, entrepreneurs will be able to raise up to $1 million via crowdfunding, which will &#8220;democratize access to capital.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That will be the difference for, I think, thousands of entrepreneurs,&#8221; Case said. &#8220;It&#8217;s an enormous opportunity for underserved regions and underserved sectors.&#8221;</p>
<p>So for example, if you&#8217;re trying to build a social media company in Silicon Valley, the JOBS Act might not affect you. But if you&#8217;re in Detroit and you&#8217;re trying to expand a local business or take a product &#8220;to scale,&#8221; crowdfunding could help you raise the money you need.</p>
<p>Josh Linkner of Detroit Venture Partners was also on stage with Case, and he echoed those points. He said that in order to build a community of &#8220;500 entrepreneurial tech companies,&#8221; Detroit needs great ideas, great talent, and capital. The city already has the first two, and the JOBS Act will provide more access to the third.</p>
<p>Case and Linkner also talked more generally about American competitiveness, which <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/steve-case-techonomy-american-competitiveness/">I covered in another post</a>.</p>
