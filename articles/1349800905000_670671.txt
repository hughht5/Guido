Gmail users can now easily switch between over 100 virtual keyboards and transliterations. In addition, you can now use Google&#8217;s Input Method Editors (<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_method_editor">IME</a>) to convert your keystrokes to Asian characters. This, says Google, means you won&#8217;t &#8220;find yourself limited by the language of your keyboard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks to the virtual keyboards, which support languages like Arabic, Hebrew, Thai and Korean, Gmail now supports typing in 75 languages. The Input Method Editor currently supports <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin">Pinyin</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wubi_method">Wubi</a> IME&#8217;s for Simplified Chines and Pinyin and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bopomofo">Zhuyin/Bopomofo</a> IME&#8217;s for traditional Chinese and Japanese.</p>

<p>To turn these new input methods in Gmail on, just head over to your <a target="_blank" href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/general">Gmail settings</a> and look for the option to &#8220;Enable input tool&#8221; and follow the instructions <a target="_blank" href="http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=139576">here</a>. It looks like Google is rolling out this new feature slowly, so if you don&#8217;t see it in your Gmail account yet, check back later today.</p>
<p>Previously Google already offered a similar feature set through its <a target="_blank" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-input-tools-by-goo/mclkkofklkfljcocdinagocijmpgbhab">Google Input Tools Chrome extension</a>. If you often need to switch between languages, the Chrome extension is still worth a look &#8212; even now that this has become a built-in feature in Gmail, as it works across a number of other tools, including Google Drive, Search and Translate. Google also offers a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/inputtools/cloud/">Windows desktop client and an Android app</a> with similar functionality.</p>
