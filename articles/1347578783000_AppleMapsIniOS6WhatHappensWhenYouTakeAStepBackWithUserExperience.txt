As per usual, the update brings a lot of new stuff to the table. Good stuff that will significantly improve user experience. But in a rare move for Apple, it also ticks the needle back a few notches in at least one big way: Google Maps is leaving as the platform&#8217;s built-in solution.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s replacement, its own house-built (with a <a title="Confirmed: Waze And Others Contributing To Apple’s iOS 6 Maps’ Crowd Sourced Traffic Data" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/12/confirmed-waze-contributing-to-apples-ios-6-maps-crowd-sourced-traffic-data/">little help from TomTom, Waze and others</a>) Maps.app, just isn&#8217;t at the same level as Google&#8217;s solution, and for good reason. As was discussed in the panel I hosted yesterday at TechCrunch Disrupt (embedded below), Google has had a huge head start on maps, having worked on Google Maps since the kernel behind it was acquired when the company bought Where 2 Technologies in 2005.</p>
<p>For its part, Apple seems to have had a similar starting point, but one that took place a full four years later when it <a title="Apple Gets A Mapmaker. Where Does That Leave Google?" href="http://techcrunch.com/2009/09/30/apple-gets-a-mapmaker-where-does-that-leave-google/">bought Placebase in 2009</a>. And without a web-based precursor, there&#8217;s been nothing for the company to cut its teeth on. The refinement process will have to happen solely on a mobile platform, with a smaller user base and less flexibility in terms of pushing fixes and major improvements between iOS point version releases.</p>
<p>Maps will be something Apple users aren&#8217;t used to: a significant backslide in a core element of a product that people have come to understand how to use naturally and without much thought. It&#8217;s not insignificant – it changes fundamentally the process of getting directions, especially for those who use public transit, and not for the better. Using Yelp for points of interest is good, but still doesn&#8217;t feel quite up to the level of searching for places in Google Maps.</p>
<p>Ultimately making the move to its own maps solution will probably end up as a win for consumers. Competition between the two products will drive innovation on both sides, so Android users should also benefit, and Apple will ultimately build a product that feels at home on a device where it currently comes across as a bit of a stranger. Turn-by-turn navigation is a hugely welcome addition, and one that Android users have had for a while now. There have also already been a whole lot of <a target="_blank" href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/12/07/16/apple_releases_ios_6_beta_3_to_developers.html">improvements made</a> to the product since Apple&#8217;s first iOS 6 beta release, so the company is clearly working hard to raise the bar.</p>
<p>Hard work or no, users will react to the change, and most won&#8217;t worry about being patient with a company just starting out on fresh new legs in a brand new area, as Macworld&#8217;s Jason Snell points out in the clip below. This isn&#8217;t likely to dampen pre-order enthusiasm for the iPhone 5, but it will be a good opportunity to see what happens when Apple messes with some very basic parts of the formula that&#8217;s made the iPhone the massive success it is today.</p>
