<p>During the Q4 Apple earnings call, Cook addressed words spoken by Steve Jobs in the past regarding a 7-inch tablet</p>
<blockquote><p>On comments that Steve made before about 7 inch tablets, let me be clear, we would not make one of the 7 inch tablets, we don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re good products, we&#8217;d never make one.</p></blockquote>
<p>In case you&#8217;re wondering what Steve Jobs said about the 7-inch form factor, here&#8217;s his original quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>7-inch tablets are tweeners: too big to compete with a smartphone and too small to compete with the iPad. &#8230;.7-Inch tablets are dead on arrival.</p></blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, the new iPad mini, which is 7.9 inches is not a &#8220;compromised product&#8221; according to Cook. He&#8217;s clearly referring to products from Samsung, Asus and Google.</p>
<p>Regarding Apple customers and providing them with the best of class, Cook says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Customers are very smart, have high expectations and they want a device that can do more.</p></blockquote>
