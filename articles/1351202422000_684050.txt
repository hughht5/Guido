<p>During the Q4 Apple earnings call, Cook addressed words spoken by Steve Jobs in the past regarding a 7-inch tablet</p>
<p>&#8220;Comments that Steve made before about 7 inch tablets, let me be clear, we would not make one of the 7 inch tablets, we don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re good products, we&#8217;d never make one&#8221;  </p>
