The story cited sources &#8220;familiar with the matter,&#8221; who confirm that Apple is in intensified talks with major music labels to figure out how to split ad revenue.</p>
<p>The service is expected to launch next year, in 2013.</p>
<p>Obviously, this would be a huge hit to Pandora, which currently owns the crowded Internet radio market. In fact, Pandora&#8217;s shares dropped 12 percent yesterday to $8.20.</p>
<p>The idea behind the Apple Internet radio is actually relatively simple. The company already has a foot in the door with most major music labels — iTunes, digital downloads, etc. — and this is just a progression of those talks.</p>
<p>Whereas Pandora, and many of its competitors, use a compulsory license to stream music to users, Apple is looking to forge direct deals with labels for more comprehensive and flexible licensing.</p>
<p>In other words, Apple radio probably won&#8217;t ever tell you that you can&#8217;t skip a song. And unlike Pandora, if you want to listen to all Johnny Cash, all the time, Apple won&#8217;t fold in music that&#8217;s similar to Johnny Cash just to follow licensing requirements.</p>
<p>In essence, it is expected to be the best internet radio ever. If real, of course.</p>
<p>Rumors have swirled <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/15/apples-stream-dreams-the-history-of-a-potential-pandora-killer/">since September</a> (and earlier) that Apple was working on a Pandora-killing radio product. It&#8217;s expected that the service will run as an app for desktop and iOS devices, rather than as a web service.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/25/apple-q4-2012/">fourth quarter earnings call yesterday</a>, Apple reported that iTunes had hit record revenues, but the company also revealed that iPod sales are down 19 percent year-over-year. Just like CDs, cassette tapes, and 8 tracks before them, digital downloads that take up valuable space on your gadgetry will go out of style.</p>
<p>Of course, new iPods will probably invigorate iTunes even more in the coming quarter, but an extra revenue stream from music (where Apple arguably got its wings and learned to fly) isn&#8217;t a bad idea at all.</p>
