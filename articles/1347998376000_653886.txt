Facebook tells me that similar to its <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/22/zynga-facebook-ads/">first off-site ad placements on Zynga.com</a>, the goal is to show Facebook users more relevant ads wherever they go, even outside the social network&#8217;s own properties.</p>
<p>If you were looking for a big new way Facebook could make money without hurting its user experience, here it is.</p>
<p>Facebook isn&#8217;t revealing any of the advertisers, ad exchanges, or publishers involved, but here&#8217;s how the small initial test of its mobile ad network will work:</p>
<p>Starting later today, you may start seeing banner and interstitial ads targeted by your Facebook biographical and social data within non-Facebook mobile iOS and Android apps plus mobile websites where you&#8217;ve authenticated with Facebook. The targetable data includes your age, gender, location, Likes, friends who&#8217;ve used an advertiser&#8217;s app and basically any other targeting options in Facebook&#8217;s standard ads marketplace.</p>
<p>On the back end, advertisers set a bid they&#8217;re willing to pay Facebook to reach a certain demographic of users. Meanwhile, Facebook syncs its anonymous user IDs with several mobile ad exchanges. When a Facebook user visits one the apps or sites where these exchanges have placements, they instantly send Facebook that user&#8217;s ID and asks if there&#8217;s bid set to target them. If so, Facebook pays the ad exchange some portion of the bid, and the ad is shown to the user.</p>
<p>Those ads can lead to App Store pages where users can download something, or to mobile website that might be services, ecommerce, or brand promotions.</p>
<p>The mobile ad network lets Facebook earns money on traffic to other apps and sites by leveraging its remarkably expansive and accurate user data set. It gives app developers and brands such a powerful way to reach specific audiences that they&#8217;ll be willing to pay more than if they advertised with a less accurate ad exchange directly.</p>
<p>Facebook tells me &#8220;Right now we&#8217;re testing to see how these ads perform, whether people find them relevant They could be an interesting way to discover new mobile apps and see relevant ads off of Facebook. The mobile ad network&#8217;s value to advertisers is that &#8220;With Facebook you have really great targeting. They&#8217;ll be able to reach people that are more likely to engage with the ads they see.&#8221;</p>
<p>If users tap in, it could blossom into a big way for Facebook to make money without having to clutter its own apps with ads.</p>
