<p>There seems to a glut of social newsreading services nowadays, but Abrams said there&#8217;s nothing that really gave him want he wanted — a fast, easy-to-use newsreading experience. To demonstrate that, he had me create my own account on Nuzzel. I connected my Twitter account (you can connect Facebook, too), and within seconds, I had a page of headlines shared by the people I follow on Twitter, along with their commentary, and related news and stories from sites like Reddit, Hacker News, and Techmeme. The headlines can be arranged based on how many of my friends shared them, or arranged chronologically.</p>
<p>Abrams&#8217; approach is pretty different from the newsreading apps that I&#8217;ve been seeing recently. For example, Prismatic CEO Bradford Cross emphasizes the app isn&#8217;t just presenting stories from users&#8217; Twitter feeds, and instead tries to understand their interests. Abrams, on the other hand, wholeheartedly embraces the idea that this is content that you could also see on Twitter. In fact, he says he originally created the site based on his Twitter usage — he was getting more and more of his news from Twitter, rather than RSS, but he was also missing a lot because he wasn&#8217;t on Twitter all the time.</p>
<p>Abrams says he&#8217;s also skeptical about trying to analyze a user&#8217;s interests. You don&#8217;t want to force users to enter their interests, because, &#8220;People don&#8217;t want to do a lot of work.&#8221; Also, people are interested in different topics to different degrees. That&#8217;s hard to gauge with technology, but in some ways who your social connections serve as a decent proxy — Abrams is very interested in technology and entrepreneurship, and only casually interested in politics, and that&#8217;s reflected in who he follows.</p>
<p>At the same time, Nuzzel does allow you go beyond your immediate social graph, with a &#8220;stories you may have missed&#8221; section, which shows headlines shared by friends of friends, or the people followed by the people you follow. You can also see other users&#8217; Nuzzel streams, which can in fact become a proxy of sorts for following different interests — <a target="_blank" href="http://beta.nuzzel.com/anthonyha">my profile</a>, for example, is sort of a feed for startup news. The difference between this and a more interest-focused approach, Abrams says, is that &#8220;the intelligence lies within the human, not the computer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nuzzel is also available as a mobile website, and Abrams says that now that the site is public, he&#8217;s ready to raise some money and hire a team (it&#8217;s been a solo project so far), whose tasks will include building native mobile apps.</p>
