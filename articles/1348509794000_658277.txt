That means that Verizon iPhone 5 owners can effectively use their devices with any GSM carriers around the world, including AT&amp;T in the U.S.</p>
<p>That freedom not only to travel, but even to switch carriers within the U.S. once a contract expires puts a big premium on Verizon iPhone devices, if you ask me, allowing customers to save money both in the near- and long-term. It also increases the resale value of used Verizon devices, since the person you&#8217;re selling to doesn&#8217;t have to be on the same carrier.</p>
<p>There is a significant caveat, however: The iPhone 5 from Verizon will need Verizon&#8217;s network to achieve true 4G LTE speeds, while on AT&amp;T it would have to settle for so-called &#8220;4G&#8221; HSPA+ network connections. That&#8217;s still a far cry better than being limited to EDGE, however, and probably plenty fast enough for most people.</p>
<p>As for the competition, AT&amp;T has a policy of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.att.com/esupport/article.jsp?sid=KB414532&amp;cv=820#fbid=zKgnEk34ykc">unlocking phones once they&#8217;re off-contract</a>, and Sprint provides unlocking for international use only after a customer has been in good standing for six months or more.</p>
<p>Long story short, frequent business travelers looking for as little hassle as possible when taking their phones on the road would do well to give Verizon a good long look if they&#8217;re interested in buying an iPhone 5. Well played, Verizon.</p>
