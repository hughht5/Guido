Examples &#8212; Boss: &#8220;Where are you?&#8221; Employee: &#8220;On my way to the office.&#8221; Boss: &#8220;Show me.&#8221; ||| Mom: &#8220;Where are you?&#8221; Son: &#8220;At Jimmy&#8217;s house&#8221; Mom: &#8220;Show me.&#8221;</p>
<p>With geo-coded messages, you have to be where you say you are. Whether it&#8217;s a parent, employer, or spouse, anyone with a little power over you can demand you verify your location.</p>
<p>Sometimes you&#8217;re running late. Sometimes you aren&#8217;t where you&#8217;re supposed to be. You might be still in bed when your boss calls, or a kid could be biking through the night with their little hooligan buddies when they were supposed to be safe asleep at a friend&#8217;s house.</p>
<p>But until recently, the  only thing someone had to go on was your word. They asked you over a voice call where you were, you told a little white lie, and then rushed to be where you said you were before they found out.</p>
<p>Now, someone could request a screenshot of your blue dot on your mobile map. Or that you send a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/04/facebook-messenger-read-receipts/">geo-coded Facebook message</a> that shows your current location. Hell, they could force you into a video call and request you to show the traffic you&#8217;re supposedly stuck in, or the house you&#8217;re supposed to be at.</p>
<p>Even if not demanded, this information is now getting passively transmitted, sometimes by default. A friend and I were exchanging geo-coded Facebook Messages the other day when he asked if we were still on for a meeting I was late to. For a split second I wanted to say I was already en route. Not true. Still lacing up my shoes. </p>
<p>So I told the truth, &#8220;Hey, sorry I got a late start but I&#8217;m still at my house. About to leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s happening now, ask some savvy parents or people with suspicious spouses. It will only get more common if data-as-SMS protocols like iMessage gain geo-coding capabilities, which have plenty of consensual use cases</p>
<p>Taken to the extreme, that might mean we can&#8217;t hide from Big Brother governments. But in our personal lives, the ability for others to technologically verify the truth will persuade us to tell it more often. </p>
<p>Like it or loathe it, this is a new social contract we&#8217;ll have to adapt to.</p>
