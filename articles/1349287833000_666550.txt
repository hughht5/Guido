However, I would say that the Curiosity Rover on Mars is seeing cooler scenery than I ever have. Today, foursquare reported that the <a target="_blank" href="https://foursquare.com/marscuriosity/checkin/506c75a2067da29edeec7e2e">craft has checked in on foursquare</a> for the first time.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.foursquare.com/2012/10/03/foursquare-in-space-follow-marscuriosity-as-it-explores-the-red-planet/">what the company had to say about it</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today, NASA’s Curiosity Mars Rover checked in for the first time on Mars, marking the first Foursquare check-in ever on another planet (and the second check-in in space!). Carl Sagan would be proud.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/03/thats-a-first-nasas-curiosity-rover-successfully-checks-into-foursquare-from-mars/marscuriosity/" rel="attachment wp-att-666577"></a></p>
<p>Most excitedly, throughout its 23-month exploration of Mars (which began last month), the Mars Rover will continue to check in and share updates on Foursquare.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s pretty cool. Other than being a gimmick, this shows off the power of geolocation technology, as it can be used as a virtual &#8220;stake in the ground&#8221; in uncharted territory. With Google and Apple duking things out on maps and location, foursquare is quietly doing its thing, and quite well I might add. Its Explore tab keeps getting better, and the future looks bright for the company.</p>
<p>Google is doubling down on indoor geolocation, and I&#8217;d love to be able to check in from my favorite bar stool in the city on foursquare one of these days.</p>
<p>Until then, it&#8217;s safe to say that the Curiosity Rover will remain Mayor of Mars for quite some time, but hey I&#8217;d like to give it a run for its money. <a target="_blank" href="https://foursquare.com/nasa">Track the Rover on foursquare, here.</a></p>
