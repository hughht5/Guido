Today, the company has <a target="_blank" href="http://www.salesforce.com/company/news-press/press-releases/2012/09/120920-4.jsp">officially announced it</a>. It is name-dropping Dropbox in its promotional description, calling it &#8220;The Dropbox for the Enterprise&#8221;, as part of its bigger push into cloud services and &#8220;consumerizing&#8221; enterprise IT.</p>
<p>The company is releasing the news in a raft of announcements to coincide with its Dreamforce conference. Other news includes a new identity management service, a new <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/19/salesforce-blends-buddy-media-with-radian6-for-its-new-social-marketing-cloud/">social marketing cloud</a> (with Radian6 and Buddy Media integration) and performance management via <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/19/salesforce-debuts-rypple-powered-work-com-to-help-companies-manage-talent/">Work.com</a>. The</p>
<p>The Chatterbox service is first and foremost about secure file sharing across devices. It is designed to be integrated with other Salesforce products such as Chatter &#8212; is enterprise messaging service (read: Yammer compeitor) that is now already in use acros 170,000 networks at companies like Dell, Kelly Services and Virgin America. That&#8217;s also an instant potential customer base for the service. </p>
<p>Yesterday we noted that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/18/salesforce-com-to-announce-cross-company-instant-messaging-for-chatter/">Chatter</a> itself will also be getting some upgrades, including the ability to let users chatter with those in other networks and companies &#8212; something the company confirmed today.</p>
<p>Integrating file storage, sharing and transfer with communications is a key focus for those playing in the enterprise cloud services space, where workers want to talk about a work project and then share files related to that in real time, in the same space. Others like Huddle have been offering such services for a while, and Microsoft-owned Yammer is expected to also unveil similar collaboration tools in the coming months, we&#8217;ve heard. This announcement may bring the launch date for that up a bit closer.</p>
<p>For now it looks like Chatterbox will be limited to file collaboration only within a company &#8212; not with others. It will allow for mobile as well as desktop access, and will automatically post notices of files uploaded to Chatterbox directly into the Chatter social feed.</p>
<p>As background, Chatter is Salesforce&#8217;s Yammer equivalent, in other words a kind of &#8220;Facebook for enterprise.&#8221; Chatter combines social networking features like profiles, real-time feeds, trending topics, recommandations and influence measurement. It integrates into other Salesforce apps as well as those built by third parties for the Salesforce platform.</p>
<p>In addition to the ability to chatter with those outside your company&#8217;s network, Salesforce confirmed some other developments for Chatter. They include an instant messaging service, Chatter Messenger, and a screensharing option.</p>
<p>Salesforce says that Chatterbox, which will start to be available in 2013, came out of a demand among Saleforce&#8217;s existing customers for a Saleforce equivalent of Dropbox.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our customers have been asking us to create a file sharing service like Dropbox for the enterprise,&#8221; said Nasi Jazayeri, EVP and GM of Salesforce Chatter, salesforce.com, in a statement. &#8220;Now with Salesforce Chatterbox, employees will be able to securely access and share their files with the trust of Salesforce.&#8221;</p>
<p>Next up for integration? Perhaps voice services.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how and if Box and Dropbox respond to this move.</p>
