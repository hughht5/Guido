The site is now back up. In all, the attack kept GitHub down for about 90 minutes.</p>
<p>The first report of the site going down came at 1:05 p.m. with the following  <a target="_blank" href="https://status.github.com/">status update</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re experiencing some connectivity issues at the moment. GitHub.com is currently unavailable while we resolve this.</p></blockquote>
<p>GitHub acknowledged the attack at 1:33 p.m:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are experiencing issues due to a DDOS attack, working hard to restore service</p></blockquote>
<p>Last month, a<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/14/github-explains-this-weeks-outage-and-poor-performance/"> database migration went awry</a> on GitHub causing an outage and poor availability.</p>
<p>Disruptions have nagged GitHub over the past week. Two minor disruptions occurred yesterday and the day before.</p>
