The call will take place at 2:00 P.M. PT/5:00 P.M. ET, and will provide another early glimpse into how the iPhone 5 is doing since the quarter ended in September.</p>
<p>You can follow the conference call <a target="_blank" href="http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/12epjwgpjviociytiy10/event/index.html">live at Apple&#8217;s events site,</a> but we&#8217;ll also be bringing you the results and a wrap-up of the call.</p>
<p>Already, some analysts have been making predictions about the company&#8217;s Q4 results. Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu shared numbers that see around 27 million iPhones being sold in the September quarter, for instance, buoyed by the iPhone 5. He said in the note that despite lukewarm reviews, Apple&#8217;s sales tend to be brisk quarter after quarter, and should remain so once again.</p>
