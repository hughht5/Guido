The new design is definitely eye-catching, but does performance live up to the looks? Read on to find out.</p>
<h2>The Good</h2>
<p>These definitely sound better than those earbuds you got with your iPhone 4S and immediately put into a drawer, never to think about again. The sound is much richer and more like what you&#8217;d get from Apple&#8217;s In-Ear Headphones, though without the sound isolation since they don&#8217;t form a seal in your ear canal. That is actually better for general commuting use, however, since it means you can still hear traffic and other environmental sounds.</p>
<p>One thing everyone will probably appreciate is much better bass performance. It&#8217;s not overpowering, which you might get on a pair of Monster Beats, and that&#8217;s a good thing. You also get better stereo effects, all resulting in a much more immersive listening experience.</p>
<p>Comfort is pretty much a toss-up between these and the last. They do feel a little less likely to fall out of your ears or shift around while you&#8217;re walking and wearing, though it also takes a little bit longer to get them seated correctly in the first place.</p>
<p>Smaller openings that don&#8217;t use a huge grill alone should increase element resistance and make them more durable, and Apple claims overall they&#8217;re designed to better take a beating, and early impressions bear that out.</p>
<h2>The Bad</h2>
<p>It would be hard for the new EarPods to be worse at anything than the earbuds they replace, if only because those were so bad in every regard. However, one thing I did notice was that the controls/mic pod felt a little bit flimsy and light, which could be a concern for long-term wear, but that could admittedly also just be a mistaken impression.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>The new EarPods are better than the old ones, and they come free with new iPhones and iPods, so you can&#8217;t really complain. Plus, at $29, while I&#8217;m not sure they rival some of my favorites like the Bowers &amp; Wilkins C5 or Klipsch S4i, they sound pretty good. Definitely a better buy than the lackluster In-Ear Headphones with Mic for $79 as a standalone purchase.</p>
