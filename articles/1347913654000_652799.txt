<p>Samsung and LG have already crossed the 5-inch smartphone screen barrier, and now it seems that HTC is planning to make a similar leap any day now. 	The folks at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/17/htc-5-inch-behemoth-phone-may-be-called-one-x-5/">Engadget </a>happened upon what appears to be an early press render of a hefty new HTC handheld &#8212; supposedly dubbed the HTC One X 5 because of its sizable screen &#8212; on Chinese microblogging site Sina Weibo.</p>
<p>But what&#8217;s that you say? The device in question looks a little familiar? </p>
<p>That&#8217;s not entirely a surprise. A leaked spy shot (see below) of an unknown HTC phone started making the rounds recently, and the color scheme, button layout, and placement of the front-facing camera seem to indicate that these two devices are indeed one and the same. Should that be the case, then the One X 5 may well sport a Snapdragon S4 chipset, 1.5GB of RAM, and a 1080p display, though some of the specifics don&#8217;t quite add up. <a target="_blank" href="http://htcsource.com/2012/09/exclusive-5-inch-htc-dix-phablet-to-feature-quad-core-processor-1-5gb-of-ram-and-16gb-of-internal-storage/">HTCSource&#8217;s insider</a> claims that the device&#8217;s display has a whopping 480 ppi pixel density &#8212; a number that doesn&#8217;t really make sense since a 5-inch screen running at 1080p should top out at 440ppi or so &#8212; but I&#8217;m willing to chalk that up as a minor goof. </p>
<p>The red-and-black trim also seems to point to a future on Verizon Wireless (where it could sport the <a target="_blank" href="http://htcsource.com/2012/09/exclusive-5-inch-htc-dix-phablet-to-feature-quad-core-processor-1-5gb-of-ram-and-16gb-of-internal-storage/">Droid Incredible X</a> moniker), but that&#8217;s not exactly a lock. Remember the similar-looking HTC Sensation XE? (Please tell me I&#8217;m not the only one.) Still, the fact that the benchmarks of a similarly-spec&#8217;d device (and clearly Verizon-bound) HTC phone first appeared online <a target="_blank" href="http://www.droid-life.com/2012/07/12/htc-device-headed-to-verizon-stops-by-glbenchmark-1080p-display-model-6435lvw-and-a-new-snapdragon-s4/">earlier this summer</a> could mean that the One X 5 may soon appear on domestic store shelves, albeit possibly without a stylus in tow.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s little question that HTC has something up its proverbial sleeve, but when will it finally see the light of day? It could be awfully soon &#8212; HTC does have a big press event on the books this week &#8212; but I wouldn&#8217;t hold my breath just yet. The prevailing theory is that the Taiwanese OEM will instead unveil its<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/04/htc-schedules-september-19th-event-expect-windows-8-devices/"> new Windows Phone 8 devices</a>, though I don&#8217;t think any of us would mind being surprised by a top-tier Android device once the event is under way. </p>
