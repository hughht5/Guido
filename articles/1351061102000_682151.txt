Amazon continues to extend its reach into new markets and increase its focus in Asia: today it announced <a target="_blank" href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1749134&amp;highlight=">pre-orders for its first Japanese-language Kindle</a>, the Paperwhite, and, in another first, it has now extended its <a target="_blank" href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1749134&amp;highlight=">Kindle Store into Japan</a>, opening with 50,000 titles in the library. It also today made Japan the latest market for Amazon&#8217;s Kindle Fire tablets: it <a target="_blank" href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1749133&amp;highlight=">kicked off sales</a> of the Kindle Fire HD and Kindle Fire in the country.</p>
<p>The news comes as Amazon&#8217;s local rival, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rakuten.co.jp">Rakuten</a>, continues to press ahead with its ambition to match and beat Amazon at its own game both at home and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-10-11/rakuten-to-expand-in-asia-as-japan-online-retailer-chases-amazon">further afield</a>. In addition to is main business selling books and other goods online, Rakuten recently also introduced its own e-reader, the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/02/kobo-japan/">Kobo Touch Reader</a>, aiming it at the same low-cost market as Amazon by pricing it at $99. Rakuten in May made a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/17/rakuten-ceo-on-the-100b-pinterest-round-we-want-pinterest-users-to-pin-images-and-buy-using-our-id/">$100 million investment in Pinterest</a>, which it has already started to leverage by integrating its marketplace with the platform.</p>
<p>Given that Amazon has already been selling books in Japan for the past 12 years, it has definitely not rushed to launch its Kindle line in Japan &#8212; so is today&#8217;s news a sign that it must now be feeling Rakuten&#8217;s rivalry?</p>
<p>&#8220;After twelve years of selling print books on Amazon.co.jp, we are excited to offer the millions of Amazon.co.jp customers the new Kindle Store, with the largest selection of the books people want to read, the largest selection of Oricon best sellers in books, bunko, and manga, and over 50,000 Japanese-language titles—all available to anyone with a Kindle Paperwhite, Kindle Fire, Android phone, Android tablet, iPhone, or iPad,&#8221; said Jeff Bezos, Amazon.com Founder and CEO.</p>
<p>Among the 50,000 Japanese-language titles in the new store, 10,000 will be free. There is also a strong emphasis on graphic literature, hugely popular in Japan, with 15,000 manga titles.</p>
<p>The Kindle Store, Amazon says, will open for business in October 25 with some 68 Japanese-language titles exclusive to Amazon. Meanwhile, the Kindle Paperwhite will sell for ¥8,480 ($106). Amazon had announced its intention to extend its Kindle brand into Japan in September. That followed with the company <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/04/amazon-opens-mobile-app-distribution-portal-to-japan-continues-expanding-international-appstore-reach/">extending its mobile app distribution portal</a> to Japan earlier in October.</p>
<p>When Amazon launched its first Kindle e-reader in 2007, the company was criticised for its slow international rollout of the device. The reasons, it seemed, were three-fold: the keyboard issue (for non-English countries); carrier agreements for unlimited data usage; and trying to get the right mix of localized e-book content.</p>
<p>The move to touchscreen, keyboard-free devices,  however, has made the hardware element of going international significantly easier for the company. The growing use of tablets and e-readers, meanwhile, has given rise to significantly more content available for the devices. Lastly, the fact that many are using WiFi as the primary way of connecting their new devices means that the company has less of a need to iron out local carrier negotiations.</p>
<p>It also helps Amazon immensely to make its device footprint as wide as possible. Not only does that mean much better economies of scale for making the device, but given that it&#8217;s pinning at least some of its hope on advertising revenues generated on those devices, increasing the number of Kindle users will be a crucial part of that strategy.</p>
