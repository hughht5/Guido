Nokia fans have been excited about these for a while, considering that Windows Phone 8 brings a bit more capacity for impressive specs, and Nokia has added its Pureview imaging to the flagship 920.</p>
<p>In case you&#8217;ve forgotten, the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/05/nokia-lumia-920-official/">Lumia 920</a> has just about everything you could ask for in a smartphone, with a 4.5-inch 720p display, a 1.5GHz Snapdragon S4 processor, a relatively large 2,000mAh battery, and of course, the heady combination of Windows Phone 8 and Pureview imaging.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/05/nokia-debuts-the-4-3-lumia-820-5mp-camera-1-5ghz-dual-core-s4-processor-8gb-of-storage/">Lumia 820</a>, on the other hand, isn&#8217;t necessarily something to write home about. But, for a mid-range device (4.3-inch display, 8GB of internal memory, and a 5-megapixel camera) the Lumia 820 is a fine option for any Microsoft fans out there.</p>
<p>To boot, the Lumia 820 is the first Lumia to sport interchangeable shells, so you can switch from red to blue to yellow. Or whatever. A lot rests on the success of these phones, as Nokia has <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/02/nokia-joins-the-iphone-5-bashing-with-this-clever-lumia-920-video-ad/">recently made it clear</a> that Android <em>and</em> iOS devices are huge contenders in the mobile arena.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d expected for a while that Nokia&#8217;s Lumia phones would hit AT&amp;T, and now it&#8217;s official. AT&amp;T says the phones will be available in November.</p>
