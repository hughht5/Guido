Nest is also updating its mobile software for both iOS and Android to version 3.0 with a plethora of upgrades.</p>
<p>The $249 thermostat features an all-new, all-stainless steel ring and a sensor window that replaces the grill. Under the hood, the addition of a Y2 and star (*) connector now allow Nest users to control second stage cooling systems, among other things. In total, the second gen hardware now supports three-stage heating, emergency heat for heat pumps and whole-home humidifiers/dehumidifiers.</p>

<p>More importantly, version 3.0 of the Nest software includes or has enhanced the following features:</p>
<p>System Match: based on your system, Nest will adjust your system accordingly to maintain an optimal temperature in an efficient manner. For instance, the &#8220;early-on&#8221; feature will begin to heat or cool to ensure the desired temperature is met by the scheduled time based on a number of variables, like local weather. There&#8217;s also support for &#8220;True Radiant&#8221; and &#8220;Heat Pump Balance&#8221; systems. </p>
<p>Auto-Away/Auto-Schedule: Both of these have also been improved with auto-away seeing a significant upgrade. The feature now continuously tracks whether or not you&#8217;ll be home based on previous 30-day activity. It can now kick in 30 minutes after you&#8217;ve left instead of two hours later.</p>
<p>Both Nest apps and the system itself now support English, French and Spanish.</p>
<p>You can now control, monitor and tweak your Nest from a web browser, iOS device or Android smartphone. And for the first time, Android tablet (Nexus 7 and Kindle Fire) owners can get in on the fun.</p>
<p>The second-gen Nest is available for <a target="_blank" href="http://store.nest.com/us/">pre-order starting today</a> and will ship by mid-October. You can also find the new Nest at Amazon, Lowe&#8217;s, Apple stores. The first-generation Nest will drop to $229 and will be available at Lowe&#8217;s while supplies last. </p>
