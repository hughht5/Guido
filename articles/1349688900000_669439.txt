This follows an 11-month investigation of the two firms. The draft report is due to be released later today.</p>
<p>Huawei is the second largest global maker of telecoms equipment, while ZTE is fifth-largest. Both companies also make mobile phones and smartphones. The pair are keen to expand their presence in Western markets, and Huawei reportedly quadrupled its spend on Washington lobbyists this year. According to a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/huawei-expands-lobbying-amid-national-security-probe-by-congress/2012/08/26/4b2d06f6-ecb5-11e1-b09d-07d971dee30a_story.html">Washington Post</a> report from August, Huawei spent $820,000 on lobbying in the first six months of 2012 &#8212; up from $200,000 for the same period in 2011.</p>
<p>But despite lavishing all this cash in a bid to influence political opinion in Washington, the suspicion that Chinese telecoms companies are not pure-play profit seekers but are in fact high tech eyes and ears for the Chinese government is proving hard for them to unseat.</p>
<p>The Intelligence Committee&#8217;s draft report notes that while Huawei and ZTE may not be the only companies that present a risk to U.S. infrastructure, they are the two largest Chinese-founded, Chinese-owned companies seeking to market critical network equipment to the U.S., and noting that the Chinese government has the &#8220;means, opportunity and motive&#8221; to use them for its own ends.</p>
<p>The report cites &#8220;long term security risks&#8221; purportedly linked with the two companies&#8217; equipment and services &#8212; albeit the unclassified version of the document seen by Reuters does not provide detailed evidence of the specific allegations. Based on classified and unclassified information, the two Chinese companies &#8220;cannot be trusted to be free of foreign state influence and thus pose a security threat to the United States and to our systems&#8221;, the report adds.</p>
<p>According to Reuters, the report also finds fault with both companies for failing to satisfy its requests for documents &#8212; including detailed information about formal relationships or regulatory interaction with Chinese authorities.</p>
<p>The committee also claims to have received credible allegations from unnamed industry experts and current and former Huawei employees suggesting Huawei, in particular, may be guilty of bribery and corruption, discriminatory behavior and copyright infringement. The committee plans to refer such allegations to the Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security, according to the draft report made available to Reuters.</p>
<p>Rejecting the allegations against it in a statement emailed to the news agency, a Huawei spokesman said: &#8221;Baseless suggestions otherwise or purporting that Huawei is somehow uniquely vulnerable to cyber mischief ignore technical and commercial realities, recklessly threaten American jobs and innovation, do nothing to protect national security, and should be exposed as dangerous political distractions from legitimate public-private initiatives to address what are global and industry-wide cyber challenges.&#8221;</p>
<p>ZTE also refuted suggestions it is somehow directed or controlled by the Chinese government, releasing a copy of the letter it sent to the committee after a hearing in September stating it &#8220;profoundly disagrees&#8221; with the claims. &#8220;ZTE should not be a focus of this investigation to the exclusion of the much larger Western vendors,&#8221; the letter added.</p>
