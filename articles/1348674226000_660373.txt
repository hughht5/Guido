Not hard to guess which side I’m on — I’m on the side of innovation,&#8221; <a target="_blank" href="http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/258643-fcc-chief-takes-ubers-side-in-battle-with-dc-council">said</a> Federal Communications Commission Chairman, Julius Genachowski, in an unusual show of political support for an issue he has no authority over. The move shows the growing opposition to DC&#8217;s taxi union which is continuing its yet unsuccessful bid to regulate the popular on-demand cab service, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/15/two-victories-in-one-week-the-internet-flash-lobby-becomes-a-political-force/">after a very public online protest</a> shut down the union&#8217;s first attempt earlier in the summer.</p>
<p>While the union fronts public safety reasons for pushing regulation, the more obvious reason is that Uber&#8217;s more innovative service is cutting into Taxis&#8217; already slim business. &#8220;My business is way down and it is very difficult to make a living at this moment,&#8221; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wjla.com/articles/2012/09/uber-gains-support-from-d-c-council-members-80284.html">said</a> one D.C. cab driver to local broadcast affiliate, ABC 7.</p>
<p>Local lovers of Uber, however, are not mincing words for why they prefer it, &#8220;It is 10 times better than dirty, filthy D.C. cabs where the drivers don’t speak English and barely know where they’re going,” said resident Richard Howill to ABC 7. &#8220;It costs a little more and I’m happy to pay it.&#8221;</p>
