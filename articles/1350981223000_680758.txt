The company has raised €45 Million to date, since being founded back in 2006.</p>
<p>Spartoo said it plans to use the new funding to sustain &#8220;aggressive expansion&#8221; across the European market. The company is now profitable in its core French market, and has ramped up to become one of Europe&#8217;s largest online shoes and accessories retailers &#8212; using free and fast deliveries and returns to encourage shoppers to buy two million pairs of shoes last year in the 20 European countries in which it&#8217;s active.</p>
<p>Unique site visitors to Spartoo now number more than 12 million per month &#8212; up from <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/01/13/europes-zappos-com-spartoo-raises-e12-million/">more than 4 million unique back in 2009</a> &#8212; and the company has seen its international turnover multiply 20-fold over the past three years. The site offers shoppers a selection of more than 30,000 models from more than 700 brands.</p>
