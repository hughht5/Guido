<p>The MSN homepage&#8217;s new design is reminiscent of the Metro design that we&#8217;ve already seen on Windows and Windows Phone 7. It&#8217;s a clean, tile-based design, with big type and images, with a new News section.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s optimized to for navigating with touch screens. In fact, one of the cooler new features is the ability to &#8220;flip ahead&#8221;, where you basically swipe across the screen to flip the page and read the next article. Another new feature is the ability to &#8220;snap&#8221; content to the side of the screen. For example, if you could look up financial information on MSN Money, snap that content to the side of the screen, then open a PowerPoint presentation and copy the information in.</p>
<p>Microsoft also offered a preview of new Bing apps for search, news, and travel. Again, there was a new layout, and you could snap content to reference later. And yes, space is saved for big, glossy ads.</p>
<p>Qi Lu, Microsoft&#8217;s president of online services, closed his presentation by saying that online media  has not &#8220;lived up to the promise&#8221; of allowing marketers to build brands online. By nailing the consumer experience for the new wave of devices and services, Lu says Microsoft can change that, and can enter a &#8220;new era.&#8221;</p>
