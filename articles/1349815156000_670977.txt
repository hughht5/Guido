<p>Today, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/microsoft-announces-reed-hastings-will-not-seek-re-election-to-microsoft-board-173358441.html">Microsoft announced a shakeup</a> on the board side of the company by announcing that Reed Hastings will not be seeking re-election.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what Steve Ballmer, Microsoft CEO, had to say about the departure:</p>
<blockquote><p>Reed has been a terrific board member, and his insights and experience have really helped guide us through a critical period of transformation for both Microsoft and the industry.</p></blockquote>
<p>To say that Hastings is a busy person is an understatement. He currently sits on the boards of Netflix, Facebook and Dreambox Learning. Regarding leaving Microsoft&#8217;s board, here&#8217;s what Hastings had to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m thrilled to have served on the board at such a pivotal time for Microsoft, including the development of Windows 8, Windows RT and Microsoft Surface, which will bring exciting new opportunities for customers and the industry as a whole. I&#8217;ve decided to reduce the number of boards I serve on, so that I can focus on Netflix and on my education work.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since joining Microsoft&#8217;s board in 2007, Hastings has brought a fresh perspective to the company that is trying extremely hard to become relevant in the consumer space again. As Hastings noted, the Surface could assist with that.</p>
<p>This is developing.</p>
