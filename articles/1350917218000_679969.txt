Mozilla today <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.mozilla.org/privacy/2012/10/22/being-social-with-privacy-in-mind/">announced</a> that it has started to test new social functionality inside its Firefox internet browser &#8212; a foray into sharing and social activity, it says, with user privacy in mind. The first service to join the Social API platform for testing is <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2012/10/22/help-us-test-the-social-api-with-facebook-messenger-for-firefox/">Facebook Messenger</a>, although Mozilla says that more services are expected to be added soon.</p>
<p>The main thing is that Mozilla wants to let users control how they share information with others and on other services &#8212; but it also realizes that social media is an essential backbone to how people are using the internet today. Its Social API is a step to bridging those two areas together.</p>
<p>&#8220;User privacy is fundamental to Mozilla’s DNA; it’s not something we can sacrifice,&#8221; Tom Lowenthal, privacy and public policy for Mozilla, <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.mozilla.org/privacy/2012/10/22/being-social-with-privacy-in-mind/">writes in a blog post</a>. &#8220;Given that, we’ve set out to find a way to combine these two aspects and enable an experience that users can enjoy, safely.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Social API, now in beta, will essentially integrate social features directly into the Firefox browser. In the case of Facebook Messenger, users will be able to access Facebook&#8217;s chat service via the browser regardless of what site they are visiting. It looks like it will also mean that developers who create apps for Firefox should also be able to integrate this functionality. This is all the more important as a route to better competing against Chrome from Google.</p>
<p>This is the first time that a Facebook feature has been integrated with Mozilla&#8217;s Firefox.</p>

<p>More to come. Refresh for updates.</p>
