<p>The Gillmor Gang — Robert Scoble, John Taschek, Kevin Marks, and Steve Gillmor — split right down the middle on the new iPhone 5. Well, @scobleizer did. He was bored by the announcement, impressed by the Apple ecosystem, and unable to come up with a good reason why we should buy anything else. @kevinmarks and @jtaschek won&#8217;t be buying it, but I already have.</p>
<p>The Gang touched on the news from Disrupt: Zuck v. HTML 5, @Benioff teasing next week&#8217;s Dreamforce, and @scobleizer&#8217;s brain trust of Normal People. But like clockwork as Verizon sold out its allotment in 60 minutes, Apple proved once again that what we once called a reality distortion field has been unmasked as just plain reality.</p>
