The owners of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.veoh.com">Veoh</a>, a video portal that claims to have millions of users worldwide, has said it has enlisted the help of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.equitypartnersCRB.com">Equity Partners CRB</a> to explore strategic options for the company, including a sale. &#8220;The company intends to focus solely on commercialization of its proprietary social video offerings,&#8221; owners Qlipso said in a statement (embedded below). The move is a sign that even with large audiences (but perhaps not large enough) video portals are facing some challenges monetizing under their existing, ad-based business models. And it may be a further sign that Veoh specifically has faced challenges in growth following <a target="_blank" href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20111220/11021717143/veoh-still-perfectly-legal-also-still-dead-due-to-bogus-copyright-lawsuit.shtml">lawsuits</a> from big media, a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wired.com/business/2010/02/veoh-files-for-bankruptcy-after-fending-off-infringement-charges/">bankruptcy</a> in 2010, and its <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/07/qlipso-veoh/">sale to Qlipso</a> shortly after.</p>
<p>Veoh, which focuses on premium rather than user-generated content, says it currently has 3 million pieces of content in its catalog, along with revenue-sharing partnerships with  TV, cable, music and other brands worldwide. The company had raised some $80 million from investors that include Intel Capital and Michael Eisner.</p>
<p>But although there is content on the site now, it is not clear whether the sale will include it or just the platform to deliver it for someone else. Matt LoCascio, a Managing Director at EP, described the sale in a statement as &#8221;a very unique opportunity to capture massive traffic and a sophisticated technology backbone that can be used for a variety of video, social, and gaming applications.&#8221; When reached on the phone for comment, he told TechCrunch: &#8220;We&#8217;re still working out whether there will be content in the deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also noted that the sale process only started about two days ago.</p>
<p>Israel-based Qlipso bought embattled Veoh back in 2010 for a price that TechCrunch understands was in the region of only $10 million &#8212; a big discount on the $80 million originally pumped into it by investors. At the time, the CEO of Qlipso, Jon Goldman, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/07/qlipso-veoh/">described</a> the sale as an &#8220;exotic venture strategy.&#8221;</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.qlipso.com">Qlipso</a> describes itself as a social media company and also operates Mixin.com, another social video site.a</p>
