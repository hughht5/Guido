Only weirdos enjoy hugs in real life. These people, likely hopped up on some sort of drug or whatnot, actually enjoy the physical embrace of another human being. But that&#8217;s gross. The touching, the emotion, the germs. Traditional hugging is just ridiculous in the age of the Internet. It&#8217;s obsolete. For the rest of us there&#8217;s the Like-A-Hug wearable social media vest. For each &#8220;like&#8221; you receive on Facebook, this vest inflates a little big, giving the wearer a little squeeze of comfort.</p>

<p>Of course this thing isn&#8217;t real. Neither is my hatred of a sincere hug. As explained on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.melissakitchow.com/Like-A-Hug">the creator&#8217;s website</a>, the Like-A-Hug is &#8220;an exercise and exploration in shape display.&#8221; Melissa Kit Chow of MIT explains this concept addresses the pains of long-distance relationships and the limitations of video chat. You know, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/24/long-distance-lovers-rejoice-lovepalz-wifi-sex-toys-let-you-get-nasty-in-real-time/">like the LovePalz</a>, but with less lube.</p>
<p>The Like-A-Hug makes it possible to share feelings, says the video demo before. And that&#8217;s true. If this thing were real, it would bring Internet interactions into real life. Perhaps sadly, thanks to the Internet, it&#8217;s now possible to express emotions in many different forms. Sometimes you just want to express your sentiment by liking a person&#8217;s status, rather than sitting on the phone with them and listening to their bad day. The Like-A-Hug would put a tangible feeling to your click. Jerry explains it the best though &#8212; sometimes you just want the machine.</p>
