Yet David Temkin, AOL&#8217;s senior vice president of mail and mobile, argues that email clients haven&#8217;t kept up with the change, with the last major innovation coming in 2004, with the launch of Gmail.</p>
<p>Given its age, and its association with the &#8220;You&#8217;ve got mail!&#8221; era, AOL (which owns TechCrunch) might not seem like a natural choice to reinvent email. However, the company isn&#8217;t just bolting on some new features to the existing AOL Mail product. Instead, it&#8217;s launching an entirely new cloud-based email client called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.altomail.com">Alto</a>, which is being gradually rolled out in a limited preview starting today.</p>
<p>According to Temkin and Josh Ramirez, senior director of product for AOL Mail and Alto, Alto actually has its roots in an attempt to overhaul AOL Mail. However, it became apparent that any major redesign would falter on the attempt to serve two different audience — the existing userbase, which isn&#8217;t really interested in seeing any dramatic changes, and another group that&#8217;s looking for, in Temkin&#8217;s words, &#8220;a new product intended for and matched to the how people have for email today.&#8221;</p>
<p>The biggest change in Alto versus other email clients is a new concept called Stacks. They basically function as a way to pre-sort your email, so that you&#8217;re not stuck reading through daily deals from Groupon and notifications from Facebook when all you really want to do is see if you&#8217;ve got a new message from your mother. They&#8217;re like folders or tags, but managed through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface, and allowing users to decide that they want to make large swaths of their email bypass the main inbox entirely, to be saved in stacks where they can be read later.</p>
<p>When you first set up an account on Alto, it will create stacks for emails that are basically social notifications, daily deals, and messages from retailers (assuming there are applicable emails in your inbox). You&#8217;ll also get a stack that highlights all the photos from all the messages in all your inboxes, and another with all the attachments. You can create new stacks by just dragging emails over, and you can also customize the rules around each one — namely the specific senders, recipients, or subject lines that signal whether an email fits into a stack, and also whether each stack should skip the inbox or not.</p>
