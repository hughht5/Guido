Now you can relive the old glory days of social media with a new Chrome web app that replaces Twitter and Facebook posts about Obama, Romney, and other serious political stuff with pictures of adorable cats. Roughly 1/5th of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/22/romneys-new-facebook-app-knows-which-friends-are-most-influential/">social media users admit to blocking</a> politics-happy friends, so this app has a ready-made audience.</p>

<p>Unpolitic.me is a deliciously appropriate partnership between <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/19/new-digg-vs-reddit-vs-buzzfeed-your-mind-on-viral-content/">viral news aggregator</a>, Buzzfeed, and the makers of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/04/unbaby-me-yes-please/">Unbaby.me</a>. Unbaby.me was the original social media filter, which buried those pesky friends who bothered to burst my happy reality distortion field of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/22/magazine/22Adulthood-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">delayed adolescence</a> by shamefully celebrating procreation. Anti-politics filter, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/05/noppl-lets-you-hide-your-friends-political-posts-on-facebook/">Nopple</a>, came soon after, but only blocked politics on Facebook. Now Unpolitic.me promises to create an even larger serious news buffer by blocking Twitter as well.</p>
<p>If only Buzzfeed could expand their new app to Thanksgiving conversation, we&#8217;ll be set.</p>
