<p>I love techcrunch, but I find their website very heavy on flash and adverts and generally full of bright distracting colours. Unfortunatly my old computer also shares my view and when I open TechCrunch on multiple tabs my computer tends to freeze up a little. Yesterday I decided to make TechCrunch Lite so I could read TechCrunch without my computer giving up on me.</p>

<p>This wesite will always stay very lite weight. It is populated using node.js to pull stories from TechCrunch's RSS feeds and the blog is hosted on AWS using <a href="https://github.com/guyht/Glog">Glog</a> - a node.js blogging engine that my brother wrote.</p>

<p>Please note that this website is in the experimental stage. I apologise if you find the odd article disappearing or not appearing immediately.</p>
