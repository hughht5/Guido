There&#8217;s beer, sometimes food, but more important than any of that, TechCrunch promises the most wondrous geek party you&#8217;ve ever attended. And the latest round of meetups is almost sold out.</p>
<p>There are just a few tickets left for the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/events/detroit-meetup/">Detroit</a> and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/events/chicago-meetup/">Chicago</a> meetups; <a href="http://techcrunch.com/events/toronto-meetup/">Toronto</a> sold out within a matter of days, so RSVP now. If our past meetup tours are any indication, hitting up <a href="http://techcrunch.com/events/northern-meetup-series/">the Great White North</a> should be a real hoot.</p>
<p>No, GaGa won&#8217;t be there in a meat dress, and for that matter, there probably won&#8217;t be that many women in general. Ladies of the tech world, please help me to rectify this.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be at awesome venues like <a target="_blank" href="http://techcrunchtorontomeetup.eventbrite.com/#">Toronto&#8217;s Steam Whistle</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://techcrunchmeetupdetroit.eventbrite.com/#">Detroit&#8217;s Hockey Town Cafe</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://techcrunchchicagomeetup.eventbrite.com/#">Chicago&#8217;s Zhou B Art Center</a>, and more TechCrunchers than ever before will be in attendance. Here&#8217;s the whole roster: <a href="http://techcrunch.com/author/jordan-crook/">Jordan Crook</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/author/john-biggs/">John Biggs</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/author/matt-burns/">Matt Burns</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/author/colleen-taylor/">Colleen Taylor</a>, and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/author/darrell-etherington/">Darrell Etherington</a>.</p>
<p>Apparently we chose a Chicago venue that is a bit out of the way. The space is awesome, but a bunch of readers indicated it&#8217;s hard to get to. Uber heard your cries. Enter the promo code, &#8216;TCNOVCHI12&#8242; in the app or at Uber.com, and you&#8217;ll receive $10 off black car rides to/from the event. For more information, check out uber.com/chicago or tweet @Uber_CHI.</p>
