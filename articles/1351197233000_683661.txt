Sales possibly rose a bit thanks to the iPhone 5, which was on sale for a little while ahead of the end of the quarter on September 30.</p>
<p>In total, Apple sold 26.9M iPhones, 14M iPads, 4.9M Macs and 5.3M iPods. Sales of all types of devices grew compared to the year ago quarter, with the exception of the iPod, which contracted 19% year over year.</p>
<p>The iPad had another strong quarter, increasing sales 26% year over year, something no doubt helped by the fact that despite the fact that a 4th generation version of the iPad just launched, few predicted its arrival very much in advance, meaning customer expectations didn&#8217;t have time to affect shopping patterns ahead of its launch the way they did with the iPhone 5&#8242;s hotly anticipated arrival.</p>
<p>Macs also grew compared to last year, but only by 1 percent, suggesting people were looking for more than the updated 15-inch Retina MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>iPod sales continued to flag, which isn&#8217;t surprising. Sales of the iPod have declined steadily as customers move to purchase iPhones and iPads instead of dedicated portable media player devices. The iPod remains a category leader, but it&#8217;s just not the growth market it once was.</p>
