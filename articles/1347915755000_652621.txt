Today, the company took the covers off of four new models in its lineup, owing to Photokina getting underway tomorrow. The D-LUX 6, V-LUX 4, M, M-E and S are all going to be on display at the show, and each boasts not only Leica&#8217;s signature killer looks, but also enhanced internals to match.</p>
<p>What you might notice if you&#8217;re a fan of Leica&#8217;s line is that the naming on the M and S-series shooters seem out of step with past versions, since they don&#8217;t include a number to indicate their relative place in the overall line. That&#8217;s because Leica&#8217;s taken a page out of Apple&#8217;s iPad naming conventions book, dropping the sequence and merely iterating on the hardware itself. The new M is a successor to the M9 rangefinder, and the S succeeds the S2. The D-LUX 6 and V-LUX 4 both replace earlier numbered versions of the same, of course.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/17/leica-drops-five-new-cameras-each-not-surprisingly-both-gorgeous-and-pricey/leica-v-lux-4/" rel="attachment wp-att-652902"></a>Starting with the most affordable of these new cameras, the V-LUX 4 offers a 12.1MP 1/2.3-inch CMOS sensor, with a built-in 4.5-100mm f/2.8 zoom lens, ISO sensitivity ranging from 100 to 6400, and a burst rate of 12 fps at maximum resolution. It supports SDXC media, and captures video at up to 1080p with a cap of 29 minutes per clip. The sensor is new on the camera, as is the one stop higher maximum ISO and it basically stands as Leica&#8217;s answer to an entry-level DSLR, albeit with a fixed lens. The V-LUX 4 retails for $899 and will be available in November 2012.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/17/leica-drops-five-new-cameras-each-not-surprisingly-both-gorgeous-and-pricey/leica-d-lux-6/" rel="attachment wp-att-652901"></a>The D-LUX 6 brings a new f/1.4 -2.3 4.7 to 17.7mm zoom to the compact camera, along with a 1/1.7-inch CMOS sensor and ISO sensitivity ranging from 80 to 12,800. It handles video recording at 1920&#215;1080 at 60 frames per second, and has a 1.4MP resolution electronic viewfinder. The much faster lens and full HD video recording should be welcome improvements over the original. The D-LUX 6 will be available for $799 as of November.</p>

The M-E operates an entry-level device for the Leica rangefinder line, providing an 18MP CCD sensor, with high light sensitivity and an emphasis on photography essentials, including straight up manual focus. The M-E overall is an interesting statement, and one that will probably appeal to a lot of core photographers looking to hone their art without the frivolities that things like scene modes and video shooting have brought to most digital photography. It&#8217;s available now from authorized Leica dealers.</p>

The M&#8217;s frills will cost $6,950 for the body when it arrives in early 2013.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/17/leica-drops-five-new-cameras-each-not-surprisingly-both-gorgeous-and-pricey/die-neue-s_system_full/" rel="attachment wp-att-652906"></a>Last but not least there&#8217;s the new Leica S, priced the same as many decently equipped small cars at $21,960 for body and available as of December. It pushes the envelope for medium format digital photography, thanks to a new image sensor and board that offers impressive buffer performance for continuous shooting (up to 32 consecutive, full resolution 37.5MP images at 1.5fps) as well as a new predictive autofocus system for better capturing moving subjects. The S also offers integrated GPS and a ton of other features that are no doubt worth dropping 20 grand on, if you&#8217;re into that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Alongside this refreshed camera lineup, Leica also dropped new S-series lenses, including a 24 mm f/3.5 prime ($7,450.00), a 30-90mm f/3.5-5.6 general purpose zoom ($9,950) and a 120mm f/5.6 tilt/shift lens ($6,950). So maybe like me you&#8217;ll just be looking at all this new gear and drooling rather than pulling out your credit card, but that&#8217;s some damn good dreaming material for amateur photographers.</p>
