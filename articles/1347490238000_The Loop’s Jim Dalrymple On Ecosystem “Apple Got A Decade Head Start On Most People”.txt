Among the famous Apple writers, The Loop&#8217;s Dalrymple compared the situation of the new iPhone with competitors.</p>
<p>Even though Amazon may provide a good offer if or when they release a phone, Dalrymple said that &#8220;Apple got a decade head start on most people.&#8221;</p>
<p>In particular, when it comes to content, Apple has quietly built a big ecosystem for music, movies, apps and TV shows since the release of the first iPod and the launch of the iTunes Music Store.</p>
<p>John Gruber noted that &#8220;Amazon&#8217;s media ecosystem is almost completely U.S. only and a little bit in the U.K. whereas Apple has deals in around 100 countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apple is now capitalizing on its market advantage and is very careful with its most valuable product. In one of Apple&#8217;s promotional videos, Jony Ive said something interesting according to MG Siegler. Siegler summarized it by saying that &#8220;Apple can&#8217;t change things too drastically.&#8221;</p>
<p>When it comes to competing with the iPhone, many companies focus on hardware instead of software. Putting Android on a phone is often not enough when users want to buy music and movies. Google Play is an answer to those requests, but building a global integrated ecosystem takes years.</p>
