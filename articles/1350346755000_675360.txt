<p>In this case, you&#8217;d be directed to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/fundraising.html">A Fundraising Survival Guide</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html">The 18 Mistakes That Kill Startups</a>. The site turns Graham into a one-man Quora.</p>
<p>Adnan Akhil, one of the guys behind WWPGD said on Hacker News &#8220;It&#8217;s really just a tool we built for ourselves to get information from a specific trusted source. It helps that he has a huge catalog of work to draw from.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"></p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say WWPGD is going to give the real Paul a run for his money. Questions like &#8221;How to grow a userbase&#8221; or &#8220;How do I find find a mentor&#8221; don&#8217;t produce any results.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s got more than just entrepreneurship advice, too. It can accurately teach you how to live like Paul, or even run into him. Graham himself commented on Hacker News saying &#8220;It appears to work. I asked it where to go for lunch, and the first reference to lunch it found was Oren&#8217;s Hummus.&#8221; That&#8217;s one of his favorite restaurants in downtown Palo Alto.</p>
<p>Maybe that was one of the motives for Akhil and <a target="_blank" href="http://wwpgd.com/">WWPGD </a>co-creator Kevin Wu. We&#8217;ve seen lots of spunky young technologists building &#8220;Here&#8217;s why you should hire me&#8221; apps and pulling other stunts to land their dream jobs. Maybe their search engine will fast-track them to a spot in PG&#8217;s Winter 2013 Y Combinator class.</p>
