<p>In this case, you&#8217;d be directed to &#8220;A Fundraising Survival Guide&#8221;, and &#8220;The 18 Mistakes That Kill Startups&#8221;. The site turns Graham into a one-man Quora.</p>
<p>Adnan Akhil, one of the guys behind WWPGD <a target="_blank" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4656378">said on Hacker News</a> &#8220;It&#8217;s really just a tool we built for ourselves to get information from a specific trusted source. It helps that he has a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html">huge catalog of work</a> to draw from.&#8221; You can explore Graham&#8217;s library of essays here,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"></p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say WWPGD is going to give the real Paul a run for his money. <a target="_blank" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4656650">HN user riffraff notes </a>that questions like &#8221;How to grow a userbase&#8221; or &#8220;How do I find find a mentor&#8221; don&#8217;t produce any results.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s got more than just entrepreneurship advice, too. It can accurately teach you how to live like Paul, or even run into him. Graham himself commented on Hacker News saying &#8220;It appears to work. I asked it where to go for lunch, and the first reference to lunch it found was Oren&#8217;s Hummus.&#8221; That&#8217;s one of his favorite restaurants in downtown Palo Alto.</p>
<p>Maybe that was one of the motives for Akhil and <a target="_blank" href="http://wwpgd.com/">WWPGD </a>co-creator Kevin Wu. We&#8217;ve seen lots of spunky young technologists building &#8220;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/12/this-guy-really-wants-to-work-for-social-reward-platform-kiip-is-this-the-new-way-to-land-a-job/">Here&#8217;s why you should hire me&#8221;</a> apps and pulling other stunts to land dream jobs. Maybe their search engine will fast-track them to a spot in PG&#8217;s Winter 2013 Y Combinator class.</p>
