Via a new HTML5 embeddable framework, developers can integrate their Box accounts and information into a number of well-known third-party enterprise applications including Concur, Cornerstone OnDemand, DocuSign, Eloqua, FuzeBox, Jive, NetSuite, Oracle, SugarCRM and Zendesk.</p>
<p>Box, which now has 14 million users around the world, including 140,000 active businesses and 92 percent of the Fortune 500, is bringing pretty much all of its collaboration and document management features to outside applications including file preview, comments, tasks and search into partner and customer applications.</p>
<p>It also enables Box to be easily integrated anywhere users need access to content on the web, such as intranets, extranets, forums, wiki’s, and blogs. Box Embed is being released this week at no cost for all Box customers. Partners NetSuite &amp; SugarCRM will be launching this week, with other application support coming in the next quarter.</p>
<p>“Content is critical to every application that businesses run on,” said Aaron Levie, co-founder and CEO of Box. “By extending Box’s enterprise content and collaboration across today’s leading business applications, Box is transforming the way people and organizations access, share and manage their business information in the cloud. We’re making it incredibly simple for our partners and developers to leverage the power of Box from within their services, and to provide a central content layer for enterprise productivity.”</p>
<p>As Box&#8217;s Chris Yeh explained to TechCrunch, Box is aiming to bring contextually relevant data and the full Box experience to users in applications where employees are working, such as a CRM. He compares the ease by which the framework can be implemented to the embedding of a YouTube video in a website.</p>
