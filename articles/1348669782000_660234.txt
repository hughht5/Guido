Shipments and revenues declined here, even as worldwide market share grew. The connected device market, meaning smartphones, tablets, and PCs combined, grew 27.4% year-over-year in Q2 2012, IDC says. There was also a slight bump of 2.8% growth from Q1 to Q2. However, although total revenue was at $131.5 billion worldwide &#8211; 16.3% higher than the previous year &#8211; there was a 2.7% decline in revenue quarter-over-quarter.</p>
<p>In the U.S., the drops were significant, in terms of both shipments and revenue. Unit shipments for Q2 2012 fell 7.8% from last quarter, and were down 5% from the past year to just under 47.4 million units. Revenues dropped to $24.8 billion, a 10.3% decline from the previous quarter, and a 8.6% drop year-over-year. IDC says these numbers are a result of both the economy and, to some extent, the impact of market saturation.</p>
<p>The U.S. aside, IDC is still forecasting continued growth in the space, with worldwide total unit shipments for connected devices reaching nearly 1.2 billion in 2012, a 27.4% increase over 2011. The analysts believe that by 2013, that number will grow to 1.4 billion, a 19.2% year-over-year increase. By 2016, there will be 2 billion connected devices, with the Asia/Pacific region leading with over 860 million units. The Americas are forecast to have 600 million by 2016 and the EMEA region, 530 million.</p>
<p>Smartphones in particular, now accounting for 59% of connected device shipments, will grow 15.8% annually, to reach nearly 63% of shipments by 2016. Tablets will grow the fastest, though, rising from a 10% share in 2012 to 13% by 2016, eating into PC share, which will drop from 31% to 24% during the same time. In the EMEA region, IDC says tablets will gain share, while in the Americas and Asia/Pacific regions, volume will increase, but share will be smaller than the global total during this forecast period.</p>
