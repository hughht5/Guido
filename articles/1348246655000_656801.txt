I personally enjoy using our website, but we have so much more going on outside of it.</p>
<p>We use <a target="_blank" href="http://techcrunch.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+TechCrunch/posts">Google+</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/techcrunch">Facebook</a>, Instagram and probably 10 other things that I haven&#8217;t found out about yet, and that&#8217;s awesome. When it comes to such a great community like we have here, I want to make sure that you have the best possible experience engaging with us. You, the readers, are the most important thing to me. Period.</p>
<p>Having said that, I spoke to the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/15/rebelmouse-first-week/">folks at RebelMouse</a>, which created a beautiful &#8220;river&#8221; page of content for people. It&#8217;s kind of like a start page, and kind of like a Pinterest board. I personally love it. I asked them what it would look like if TechCrunch had a page, and we&#8217;ve come up with <a target="_blank" href="http://crunchscroll.com">CrunchScroll</a>.</p>
<p>Have a look:</p>

<p>As you check out the site, you&#8217;ll notice that we&#8217;re pulling in stuff from everywhere. In fact, we&#8217;re using the #crunchphone hashtag on Twitter today, and pulling in those tweets to <a target="_blank" href="http://crunchscroll.com">CrunchScroll</a>. We&#8217;ll be switching things up there, adding some of your tweets, promoting photos and more. It&#8217;s going to be fun.</p>
<p>Now, this is early days, but the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rebelmouse.com">RebelMouse</a> team is pretty awesome and we have some really ridiculously awesome things planned for this in the near future.</p>
<p>Stay tuned, and thank you for reading. I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts in the comments.</p>
