Version 12.10 introduces three major new features to the browser: a new fraud detection system and support for SPDY and WebSockets.</p>
<p>The new fraud detection system will look familiar to Google Chrome users. Opera&#8217;s new tool aims to protect you from phishing sites and &#8220;tells you when a webpage has been marked as being suspicious or used for illicit activity. If you get a warning, itâ€™s a good idea to think twice about visiting that site.&#8221; The company first introduced this feature <a target="_blank" href="http://help.opera.com/Mac/9.10/en/fraudprotection.html">on the desktop</a>.</p>

Opera 12.10, for example, now offers support for Google&#8217;s HTTP improvement protocol <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPDY">SPDY</a>. Now that Gmail, Twitter and numerous other sites have adopted this protocol, we&#8217;re seeing more browser vendors jump on board as well, though most mobile browsers haven&#8217;t made the move yet.</p>
<p>The new version of Opera for Android now also supports the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket">WebSocket API</a>, which improves the two-way communication between the browser and server and allows developers to create more responsive and richer mobile web apps.</p>
<p>In addition to this, Opera Mobile 12.10 supports CSS Animations and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/">Flexbox</a>, as well as new HTML5 features like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/dnd/basics/">native drag and drop</a> and the Clipboard API.</p>
