The Ngram Viewer now draws upon a larger dataset (though Google sadly doesn&#8217;t say how large exactly it now is) and got a few new features for more advanced analysis.</p>
<p>Most importantly, though, the Ngram Viewer is now a lot smarter. Last year, Google&#8217;s Natural Language Processing group built a system that can reliably identify parts of speech. Thanks to this, the Ngram Viewer now knows how often a given word in its corpus was used as a noun or verb, for example.</p>
<p>As far as new features go, the main new tool in this release is the ability to add, subtract, multiply and divide Ngram counts. This, says Google, allows you to see &#8220;how &#8216;record player&#8217; rose at the expense of &#8216;Victrola,&#8217;&#8221; for example.</p>

<p>In addition, the Ngram Viewer team also added support for Italian to the current set of available languages (English, Chinese, Spanish, French, German, Hebrew and Russian).</p>
<p>At first glance, it would seem as if a tool like this would mostly be <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram">of interest</a> to historical linguists in academia, but the project has actually been a major mainstream success for Google. As Google Engineering Manager and the project&#8217;s co-creator Jon Orwant notes in today&#8217;s announcement, he and the rest of the team were surprised by &#8220;its popularity among casual users.&#8221; Since its launch in 2010, he writes, the Ngram Viewer has been used about 50 times per minute and over 45 million graphs have been created with it.</p>
