<p>Terms of the deal were not disclosed but Traxo revealed that the transaction has been structured as an asset purchase, with the GoMiles brand, content and members being acquired but not its technology.</p>
<p>Traxo explained its interest in the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/11/techstars-launches-ten-new-startups-in-seattle/">2010 TechStars graduate</a> as a grab for data and customers, noting specifically that GoMiles&#8217; &#8220;comprehensive archive of information about each loyalty program, actionable advice on how to avoid point expirations, and a listing of attractive mileage offers&#8221; caught its eye, and adding: &#8220;We look forward to providing that same wealth of information to the broader Traxo community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Traxo users acquire a Travel Score, based on variables such as distance traveled, which can unlock Travel Perks such as car rental vouchers and travel insurance cover. The company said the additional scale GoMiles adds to its business will enable it to negotiate better Travel Perks for users. It said it also plans to invest in developing some &#8220;compelling new features&#8221; &#8212; no word on exactly what these will be yet.</p>
<p>GoMiles customers&#8217; account data will be automatically moved over to Traxo.com &#8212; including any accrued frequent flyer miles &#8212; the company said. But Traxo plans to keep the GoMiles brand going.</p>
<p>GoMiles users will be able to carry on managing their frequent flyer accounts in the usual way but will also be able to tap into Traxo&#8217;s suite of travel organisation tools &#8212; such as its travel history timeline for keeping track of trips.</p>
<p>To date, Traxo said it has raised a $1.2m seed round from travel industry angels, and added that it is &#8220;currently seeing strong interest&#8221; from west-coast VCs in a recently launched $5m Series A funding round.</p>
