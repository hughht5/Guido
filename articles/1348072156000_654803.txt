Google, of course, isn&#8217;t sitting still, and as <a target="_blank" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/19/google-updates-android-maps-app-as-apple-moves-on/">the New York Times reports</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.maps">Google Maps for Android</a> is set to get an update later today. According to this report, the main feature of this update is that Google Maps searches will now sync across devices.</p>
<p>This means Google Maps on Android will be able to show you search suggestions based on your previous desktop searches. As Google&#8217;s VP of Engineering for Maps Brian McClendon told the New York Times, â€œtyping on a phone is slow, and our goal is to reduce the amount of typing as much as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/19/google-maps-android-sync/google-maps-android/" rel="attachment wp-att-654864"></a>This, of course, is only a small update, but it probably doesn&#8217;t come as a surprise that Google announced this new feature today and even gave the New York Times an exclusive that would run in the morning ahead of the iOS 6 launch despite the fact that the feature isn&#8217;t even live yet. Apple, after all, can&#8217;t offer similar features for its users as it doesn&#8217;t offer maps on the desktop. It also took Google years to build its mapping infrastructure and the effort the company puts into curating its maps is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/09/how-google-builds-its-maps-and-what-it-means-for-the-future-of-everything/261913/">staggering</a>.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s mapping app, on the other hand, is probably the biggest disappointment of iOS 6. Gone are the transit and biking directions of Google Maps. Street View is also nowhere to be found. In return users get very pretty 3D maps (prettier than those in Google Earth) and turn-by-turn directions, but while that&#8217;s nice, Apple diminished the overall utility of the default mapping app in iOS 6.</p>
<p>Google will likely launch its own Google Maps app for iOS soon, just like it did with YouTube. It remains to be seen if the company plans to bring all of the features of the Android app, including turn-by-turn directions, to iOS, though.</p>
