Today, lockups <a target="_blank" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/steveschaefer/2012/10/29/hurricane-sandy-turns-facebook-lockup-ubs-layoffs-into-afterthoughts/">expired</a> on 234 million shares, allowing these shareholders to trade their stock on the public markets. Except, the public markets are closed today, due to the onslaught of Hurricane Sandy in the New York area.</p>
<p>The NASDAQ, on which Facebook is listed, is <a target="_blank" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/nyse-plans-to-close-its-trading-floor/">closed</a> today and perhaps for the next few days, along with the New York Stock Exchange. With these closures, all trading in the U.S. has been halted.</p>
<p>After August&#8217;s initial <a target="_blank" href="http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2012/08/17/facebook-stock/">lockup expiration of 271 million shares</a>, Facebook&#8217;s stock <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/16/facebook-stock-dips-below-20-for-the-first-time/">took a hit,</a> falling to its lowest price at the time at $19.69. In August, Accel Partners, Greylock Partners and Meritech Capital Partners all sold, but Andreessen Horowitz, Microsoft and Kleiner Perkins, kept their positions. The big sell off will probably take place on Nov. 14, when 777 million shares free up for trading.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s stock, which closed Friday at $21.94, will most probably take another hit when this new set of shares can actually be sold. Facebook&#8217;s shares saw a boost after reporting <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/23/wall-streets-happy-facebook-climbs-nearly-10-in-after-hours-trading/">better than expected earnings</a> last week. It&#8217;s unclear yet who is going to be selling in this round and how much.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll see when the markets open again. Based on Sandy&#8217;s strength and effects, it may not be until Wednesday.</p>
