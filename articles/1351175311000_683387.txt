The form shows a raise of $286 million for a new fund, Atomico Ventures III, L.P.</p>
<p>London-based Atomico was founded in 2006 by Niklas Zennström a co-founder of Skype. The firm focuses exclusively on investing in tech, with investments ranging from small seed investments to larger growth investments. Atomico&#8217;s investments include Wrapp, Rovio, Jawbone, Rdio, Hailo, Fab, and Xobni.</p>
<p>Noticeable missing from the form is Janus Friis, a Skype co-founder who also cofounded Atomico with Zennström. According to recent reports, the former duo have <a target="_blank" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/skype-cofounders-janus-friis-niklas-zennstrom-atomico-split-2012-7">parted ways</a> and are not on speaking terms.</p>
<p>Atomico previously <a target="_blank" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/skype-cofounders-janus-friis-niklas-zennstrom-atomico-split-2012-7">raised $165 million</a> in 2010. Similar to Atomico&#8217;s other funds, this fund is based in the Cayman Islands, a tax-free jurisdiction.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Atomico for comment and will update if we hear back.</p>
