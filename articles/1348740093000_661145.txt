<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18873042">EU opened an investigation into the case</a> back in July, to determine whether Microsoft had kept the commitments it made under the antitrust ruling which stipulated users should be offered a choice of browsers to ensure a more level playing field for competitors to Microsoft&#8217;s Internet Explorer browser.</p>
<p>At the time of the investigation Microsoft conceded it had &#8220;fallen short&#8221; of the ruling &#8212; a mea culpa flagged up by  EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia in the latest comments on the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;The next step is to open a formal proceeding into the company&#8217;s breach of an agreement. We are working on this,&#8221; Reuters quotes Almunia as saying. &#8221;It should not be a long investigation because the company itself explicitly recognized its breach of the agreement.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Microsoft and the EC for comment and will update once we hear back.</p>
<p>Microsoft&#8217;s penalty for failing to comply could be considerable. Reuters notes it could face fines of up to 10 per cent of its global turnover.</p>
<p>Microsoft has already paid some €1.68 billion ($2.44 billion) in fines over EU antitrust actions over the past 10+ years.</p>
<p>More to come&#8230;</p>
