Basically, to get away from installing software like Microsoft Word and the like. I&#8217;m a fan of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0hHaQgdypI">the Hall and Oates one</a>.</p>
<p>There have been a few fun videos to demo the capabilities of collaborative Google Apps, but this one is pretty darn good. It uses the show &#8220;30 Rock&#8221; as an example, and it certainly makes a case for &#8220;Going Google&#8221;:</p>

<p>With recent additions like Hangout integration for Calendars, you can set up a weekly meeting with no need to do anything other than click &#8220;Join Hangout.&#8221; These are tools that Google has been using internally for years, and it&#8217;s safe to say that it&#8217;s well dog-fooded for the rest of us.</p>

<p>Do you use Google in the workplace? What have your experiences been like? For me, personally, I can&#8217;t imagine ever installing a piece of professional software again.</p>
